CNN
         — 
    


      Donald Trump attended the first day of his civil defamation trial, watching as a jury was selected to determine how much, if any, damages the former president must pay to E. Jean Carroll for his 2019 defamatory statements about Carroll’s sexual assault allegations.
  

      Trump’s courthouse attendance Tuesday – where he attended jury selection but did not speak – came one day after his resounding Iowa caucuses win, yet another illustration of how Trump’s campaign and legal fortunes are intertwined as he navigates a race for president with multiple criminal and civil trials that could have him in courthouses up and down the East Coast in 2024.
  

      Trump watched as prospective jurors were asked about their political donations to him and his political opponents, whether they believed the 2020 election was stolen and how they got their news. He left court before opening statements to travel to New Hampshire for a campaign event Tuesday evening with the primary one week away.
  

      Trump may return to New York later this week for the rest of the trial, and his lawyers have suggested he could testify in the case, though the judge has ruled that Trump cannot try to contest a previous jury’s verdict that he sexually abused and defamed Carroll.
  

      Carroll is seeking $10 million in damages.
  

      Here are takeaways from the first day of the defamation trial:
  

    Carroll attorney argues for ‘very significant’ damages sum


      Trump left court Tuesday before opening statements began, where Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley told the jury that it had already been proven that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll in a high-end department store in the 1990s.
  

      That jury’s finding stemmed from statements Trump made in 2022, while the current case is dealing with statements Trump made while he was president in 2019.
  

      “Donald Trump sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll. He managed to get her alone in an empty department store one evening and sexually assaulted her. That’s a fact,” Crowley said. “That fact has been proven and a jury sitting in the exact seats where you’re sitting now found that it happened.”

      Crowley said that Trump’s attacks on her while he was president “unleashed his followers” and caused her to receive threats. “Trump was president when he made those statements, and he used the world’s biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll to humiliate her and to destroy her reputation,” Crowley said.
  

      The damages awarded to Carroll “should be significant, very significant,” her lawyer argued.
  

      “You will also be asked to decide how much money Donald Trump should have to pay as punishment for what he’s done and to deter him and others from doing it again,” Crowley said, noting Trump continued to post about her on social media, even as the trial got underway on Tuesday.
  

    Trump attorney: Carroll has prospered since the allegations came out


      Trump attorney Alina Habba argued that Carroll’s reputation was not harmed by Trump and that her career prospered since she came forward with the sexual assault allegations.
  

      Habba told the jury to remember, “This case is not about assault. We had that case. This case is about the defamation.”
  

      Carroll waited for the opportune time to publicly share her story to maximize coverage, Trump’s lawyer claimed.
  

      “If you make explosive allegations about a sitting president – no matter who the president – people are going to react both good and bad,” Habba said.
  

      “Now she wants President Trump to pay for the risks she took for the way she did this,” Habba said of Carroll. “She wants President Trump to pay for the mean tweets.”
  

    Jurors are familiar with Trump


      The jury selection process provided a window into the jury panel that will decide Trump’s defamation case.
  

      Manhattan, where the civil case is taking place, voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 election, 87% to 12%, though jurors can also come from other counties north of the city that are part of the Southern District of New York and aren’t quite as solidly blue.
  

      That doesn’t mean the pool was a monolith. Two of the prospective jurors said they agreed with Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen. Three potential jurors said they donated to Trump or groups supporting him. All three said that wouldn’t affect their ability to be fair and impartial. None of those prospective jurors were ultimately selected to the trial jury.
  

      More than 10 said they’d donated to Biden and other top Democrats.
  

      Three prospective jurors said they believe Trump is being treated unfairly by the US court system. A male juror in the gallery stood to answer that question before it was his turn.
  

      “You’re not in the jury box, but we know where you stand,” Judge Lewis Kaplan quipped. That juror said Tuesday he donated to Trump, went to a Trump event and believes the 2020 election was stolen.
  

      Nearly all in the jury pool said they’d read about Trump’s legal cases, though only two indicated they thought that would affect their ability to be fair. Both were dismissed before the jury was selected.
  

    What’s next in the trial


      Carroll is slated to testify Wednesday in the trial, which is expected to last a few days.
  

      Her lawyers have said they may play portions of Trump’s 2022 deposition, as well as the “Access Hollywood” tape, where Trump can be heard making vulgar comments about his treatment of women to show host Billy Bush.
  

      Trump’s lawyers have also indicated he plans to testify, although Trump has changed his mind on testifying before, including last month in his New York civil fraud trial.
  

      The judge has limited the testimony in the case to damages and harm, ruling that the jury’s verdict in the first defamation trial will also carry over to this case.
  

      Last May, a Manhattan federal jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll and then defamed her in 2022 public statements he made disparaging her and denying the allegations, awarding Carroll $5 million in damages. Trump is appealing the verdict.
  

      The defamatory statements at issue in this trial were made in June 2019, when Trump was president. Trump said, in part, “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?”
  

      Habba asked Kaplan on Tuesday to postpone the trial on Thursday so that Trump could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral. Kaplan said he already ruled he would not postpone the trial, but that Trump could testify on Monday even if the defense wraps up its case this week.
  

      “I am not stopping him from being there,” Kaplan said.
  

      “No, you’re stopping him from being here, Your Honor,” Habba responded.
  

      “The argument is over,” Kaplan said, declining to change his previous ruling."

CNN
         — 
    


      Japanese brand Uniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast-fashion retailer is selling copycats of its viral shoulder bag.
  

      Fast Retailing, the Japanese giant that owns both Uniqlo and Theory, said in a statement that the form of the “imitation products” that Shein is selling “closely resembles” Uniqlo’s Round Mini Shoulder Bag, which went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in 2022 and 2023, to the point of selling out multiple times.
  

      The crescent-shaped bag, worn across the torso and priced at just $20, was so popular it made headlines across global media and was given the top spot on fashion tech firm Lyst’s rankings of the hottest products in the first quarter of 2023.
  

      But the item’s popularity also inspired a wave of knockoff products, prompting Uniqlo to warn on its website that it was investigating alleged copies and could take legal action.
  

      Its lawsuit against Shein was filed in Tokyo on December 28 and named three of the brand’s operators — Roadget Business Pte, Fashion Choice Pte and Shein Japan — according to the Fast Retailing statement.
  

      It demands the “immediate cessation of sales of the imitation products, and compensation for damages incurred by the Company as a result of these sales.”
  

      The statement added that the sale of these counterfeits had “significantly” undermined customers’ confidence in “the quality of the Uniqlo brand and its products,” and that Fast Retailing takes a “resolute stance” against any infringement of its intellectual property.

‘There is no Coco Chanel’: Lawsuit accuses Shein of copyright infringement




      In a statement to CNN, a Shein spokesperson said the company was “currently investigating this matter.”
  

      “Shein respects the intellectual property rights of others and takes all claims of infringement seriously,” it said.
  

      The shoulder bag first began circulating on TikTok in 2022 and continued to blow up in popularity through 2023, with video creators praising its versatility, spaciousness and affordability.
  

      The most viral TikToks about the bag racked up millions of views, ranging from styling tips to “what’s in my bag” videos, unboxings and haul reviews. As of Wednesday, the hashtag #uniqlobag on TikTok has racked up more than 133.2 million views.
  

      In an investor report in the third quarter of 2023, Fast Retailer credited the shoulder bag for sparking “considerable interest on social media” and expanding its customer base among women and younger shoppers.
  

      This isn’t the first time Shein has faced legal action or controversy. Last year, three graphic designers sued the retailer in the US United States over alleged copyright infringement and racketeering, claiming Shein had sold exact copies of their designs.


      At the time, a Shein spokesperson said the company would “vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit and any claims that are without merit.”
  

      And in December, Shein was also sued by its rival Temu, also a Chinese-owned e-commerce site, which alleged Shein had used aggressive and unlawful tactics to thwart competition – the latest development in an ongoing legal fight between the two."

         — 
    


      Mirra Andreeva, tennis’ new teenage sensation, shocked Ons Jabeur in the second round of the Australian Open on Wednesday.
  

      The 16-year-old beat the No. 6 seed and three-time grand slam finalist 6-0 6-2 for her first career top-10 victory as she continues to show why she’s tipped for the top of the sport.
  

      Afterwards, the 47th-ranked Russian was full of respect for Jabeur and detailed how she has become a personal inspiration of hers.
  

      “It was one of my dreams to play against her because I really like the way she plays,” she told reporters afterwards. “As I said before, I’m inspired by her, so it means a lot. Today, it meant a lot, this match that I won.
  

      Andreeva added that she saw Jabeur as an idol because of “the way she’s on the court and off the court. She’s so nice.”
  

      “Now, after the match, she came to me, she wished me luck. I just know that she is who she is and she never changes. That’s what I like about her.”
  

      It took Andreeva just 54 minutes to dispatch Jabeur in Rod Laver Arena, a victory which books her spot in the third round of the Australian Open for the first time in her nascent career. It is the third time she has reached the third round of a grand slam having done so at the French Open and Wimbledon last year.
  

      Although she admitted afterwards that she felt “really nervous” before taking to the court against the Tunisian, Andreeva showed no signs of those nerves.
  

      She dominated from start to finish, facing just one break point across the whole contest as she hit 13 winners and only 10 unforced errors – in contrast, Jabeur totaled 24 unforced errors and just nine winners.

      At age 16 and 263 days, Andreeva became the youngest player in the Open era to claim a 6-0 opening set against a top-10 seed at a grand slam, according to the Australian Open.
  

      According to the Women’s Tennis Association, Andreeva became the second-youngest player in the Open era to concede three games or fewer against a top-10 seed at a grand slam after Jelena Dokic who beat Martina Hingis at Wimbledon in 1999.
  

      The victory came a year after she lost in the final of the girls’ competition to her friend Alina Korneeva.
  

      After the win – which she called “probably the best match” of her young career so far – Andreeva explained how she had to battle back from last year’s disappointment to reach this point.
  

      “Honestly, after I lost the final, I was just super upset. I didn’t think about anything else. For maybe a week, I was just replaying the match in my head, and I was thinking: ‘This, I should have changed this, should have changed that, I should have changed this,’” the teenager said.
  

      “Honestly, after that, after all my complaints to myself, I forgot about this match. I decided to move on. It’s not the most painful loss of my life. I will have, I’m sure, a lot of offensive matches where I may be late in the score and then I lose. Maybe. I hope this will not happen, but I think it will because it’s tennis.
  

      “After that, I just moved on. Today, when I saw that I play on Rod Laver, I said that this time I have to take my chance and I have to win on the big court for the first time, and so I did.”
  

      Andreeva will face France’s Diane Parry in the third round after the 21-year-old beat Kamilla Rakhimova in straight sets on Wednesday."

         — 
    


      The lineup for Southern California’s legendary, desert-centric Coachella music festival has officially been announced, and there’s no doubt it’ll be a good time.
  

      On Tuesday, Goldenvoice, the company that produces the long-running festival, revealed that the 2024 lineup features popular ska/punk/rock band No Doubt as one of the four headlining acts.
  

      The band’s appearance will mark a reunion between the members, which include frontwoman Gwen Stefani. No Doubt has not performed live as a band since at least 2015.
  

      Lana Del Rey, Doja Cat and rapper Tyler, The Creator are also set to headline the festival, with other notable artists such as Peso Pluma, Ice Spice, Blur, Sublime and J. Balvin slated to take one of the festival’s many stages.
  

      Just before the official lineup announcement was made on Tuesday, the No Doubt X page teased a reunion when it posted a video of Stefani reminiscing about her early days with the band.
  

      The video culminated in Stefani setting up a video call with her No Doubt bandmates  – Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, and Adrian Young – after noting how much she missed them.
  

      “You guys want to do a show?” Stefani asked, to which Kanal, Dumont and Young all replied with an enthusiastic “yes!”
  

      While No Doubt did not announce any additional concert dates, their upcoming Coachella gig marks nearly 10 years since the band has toured together. No Doubt originally formed in the mid-90s and became known for their classic hits “Don’t Speak,” “Just a Girl” and “Spiderwebs,” among many others.
  

      In the early aughts, the band went on to pursue solo projects after releasing a number of albums together. In 2004, Stefani released her first solo album “Love. Angel. Music. Baby.” and has released three more solo albums since then.
  

      Last year’s Coachella headliners included Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, Korean pop group Blackpink and singer Frank Ocean. Due to an injury, Ocean pulled out of performing the festival’s second weekend, with band Blink-182 filling in.
  

      The live music festival will return to Indio’s Empire Polo Field for two consecutive weekends on April 12-14 and April 19-21 this year."

Hong Kong
CNN
         — 
    


      China reported a record low birth rate in 2023 as its population shrank for the second year in a row. The trend marked the deepening of a demographic challenge set to have significant implications on the world’s second largest economy.
  

      The country recorded 6.39 births per 1,000 people, down from 6.77 a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Wednesday. The birth rate is the lowest since the founding of Communist China in 1949.
  

      Some 9.02 million babies were born, compared with 9.56 million babies in 2022. The overall population fell in 2023 to 1.409 billion, down 2.08 million people from the previous year, the bureau said.
  

      “To be sure, last year’s sharp decline should be partly due to the lockdowns and most likely new births will rebound in 2024, although the structural down-trend remains unchanged,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group.
  

      The country’s demographic shift comes at a time when its growth is sputtering. The NBS confirmed that China’s economy grew by 5.2% last year, compared to a government target of around 5%.
  

      While this expansion marks a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s worst economic performances in over three decades.
  

      Chinese stocks tumbled on Wednesday following the data release. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 4.1% by mid-afternoon, heading towards its lowest closing level since October 2022. The CSI300, which consists of 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell 2.2%. Both indexes had a dismal year in 2023, down more than 10% each.
  

      China has been beset by a series of economic problems, including investor exodus and deflation. The shrinking population will now force Beijing to make some structural changes in its economy and reshape sectors including health care and housing.
  

      Wednesday’s data wasn’t entirely gloomy. In the fourth quarter, China’s GDP expanded 5.2%, accelerating from the third quarter’s 4.9% growth. However, this boost may not be long-term, experts said.
  

      “There are two key drivers behind this: the unexpected, but short-lived release of pent-up demand during the [third quarter] holidays, and the low base effect of [fourth quarter] 2022,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of the China Center for Economics and Business at the Conference Board.
  

      He believes China’s GDP growth will decelerate to 4.1% in 2024 because of several significant headwinds to growth, including the ongoing property downturn and subdued consumption.
  

      In December, new home prices fell by the highest amount in nearly nine years, according to a Reuters calculation based on NBS data, and property investment slumped 9.6% in 2023 from the previous year, marking a second straight year of declines.
  

      The latest figures come after China’s population declined for the first time in decades in 2022 in what analysts said was the country’s first drop since the 1961 famine triggered by former leader Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward. Last year, China was surpassed by India as the world’s most populous country.

      The slowing birth rate comes despite a push from the government to encourage more married couples to have children following decades of restrictive birth policies.
  

      “There are fewer people getting married and fewer couples want to have children,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York.
  

      The Covid-19 pandemic also likely affected the existing trend “because of (its) impact on the economy – the economic slowdown, the high unemployment rate among young people – all of that has discouraged people from getting married and having kids,” he said.
  

      The falling birth rate coincides with a shrinking workforce and a rapidly aging population: twin challenges for China’s government as it grapples with funding health care and pensions for elderly citizens, while aiming to maintain growth in an economy manned by fewer people of working age.
  

    The ‘silver economy’


      China’s working population, classified as those between the ages of 16 and 59, declined by 10.75 million last year, adding to an ongoing contraction. The population of those over 60, meanwhile, continued to expand. More than one-fifth of the population, or nearly 297 million people, are now in that age bracket.
  

      China’s top administrative body, the State Council, last week released guidelines to strengthen the so-called “silver economy,” as part of top-down efforts to tackle the challenges of caring for a growing number of elderly.
  

      The guidelines call on companies across sectors including housing, health care and finance to tailor services and products for the elderly. Land development and local government financing should support facilities for aging residents, it added.
  

      The call to grow the “silver economy” follows protests in at least four cities last year, where thousands of elderly took to the streets to protest cuts to monthly medical benefits made as local governments grappled with deficits.
  

      China’s death rate and number of fatalities also rose in 2023 compared with the previous year, according to data released Wednesday. Authorities reported a death rate of 7.87 per thousand people and 11.1 million deaths. In 2022, there were 10.41 million deaths with a death rate of 7.37 per thousand.
  

      Last year, China experienced a major outbreak of Covid-19, with infections sweeping across the country starting in late 2022 following the abrupt relaxation of stringent pandemic controls. Experts say China has not released comprehensive data on fatalities, even as authorities have defended their Covid-19 data transparency.
  

      The increase of 690,000 deaths last year compared with 2022 is “noteworthy” when contrasted with smaller, incremental rises during pre-pandemic years, according to CFR’s Huang.
  

      The comparison highlights a marked escalation in fatalities during the Covid era, he said. However, the latest data “might not fully capture the actual number of Covid-related deaths,” he added, pointing to how the total increase in deaths between this year and last falls short of scientific estimates of fatalities during China’s re-opening.
  

    Return of youth unemployment data


      In a surprise move, the NBS brought back the monthly youth unemployment rate after a five-month hiatus.

China’s economy grew by about 5.2% in 2023, Premier Li says




      In August, the NBS suspended the release of data on joblessness among young people, after the figure hit consecutive record highs around 21% amid a broader economic slump. It said the methodology needed to be improved.
  

      In December, the jobless rate for 16- to 24-year olds stood at 14.9%, it said Wednesday. The figure excluded some 62 million students, whose main task should be “to study” rather than looking for jobs, the NBS said.
  

      It also added a new unemployment category for people in the 25 to 29 age group, which reached 6.1% in December.
  

      The real estate crisis, which is at the heart of many of China’s economic problems, has persisted.
  

      Home sales by square footage fell by 8.5% in 2023, marking the second straight year of decline, and sentiment among investors remained weak.
  

      Property investment slumped 9.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, which was also the second consecutive year of contraction.
  

      The property sector has played an outsized role in the Chinese economy, accounting for as much as 30% of GDP. Housing assets make up about 70%, the biggest proportion, of household wealth.
  

      Land sales to developers had accounted for more than 40% of local government income in the years before 2021. The sector fell into crisis about three years ago after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing.
  

      Due to the aging population, analysts widely expect housing demand to wane in the coming years, which will drag down the property industry and affect growth prospects.
  

      There were some other bright spots in Wednesday’s data though.
  

      Industrial production jumped 6.8% in December, which was better than expectations. It was the fastest growth since February 2022. For 2023, factory output rose 4.6%, faster than 2022’s 3.6% increase.
  

      Fixed-asset investment also came in above market forecasts, up 3% in December from a year earlier.
  

      Retail sales increased 7.4% in 2023, reversing the 0.2% drop in 2022. But December retail sales rose 7.4% from a year ago, missing expectations of 8% growth. That slowdown was mostly driven by slower growth in car and medicine sales.
  

      The mixed data point to the need for more stimulus measures from the government, analysts said.
  

      “Policy easing will continue to be desperately needed to ensure the economic recovery is secured in 2024,” said Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP, a Swiss private bank.

         — 
    


Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
  

Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
  

      Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
  

      Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
  

      It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
  

      “It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
  

      Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
  

      “Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
  

      She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
  

      China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”

Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base




      The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.
  

      Authorities in Balochistan province told CNN two girls had died and at least four people were injured. The girls, aged eight and 12, were killed in houses that were damaged in the attack in the village of Koh-e-Sabz in Kulag, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Panjgur district, on Tuesday evening, according to the district’s deputy commissioner Mumtaz Khetran.
  

      Khetran also said a mosque near the homes was targeted and hit in the strikes.
  

      Koh-e-Sabz — about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Pakistan’s border with Iran — is known to be the home of Jaish-ul-Adl’s former second-in-command Mullah Hashim, who was killed in clashes with Iranian forces in Sarawan, an Iranian region adjacent to Panjgur, in 2018.
  

      Last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
  

      Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice, is a separatist militant group that operates on both sides of the border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its stated goal is the independence of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province.
  

      Iran said Wednesday it “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that “none of the nationals of the friendly country of Pakistan were targeted” in the strike.
  

      “We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. But we don’t allow our national security to be compromised and to be played with and we have no reservation when it comes to our national interests,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
  

      The strikes in Pakistan came a day after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched ballistic missiles, targeting what it claimed was a spy base for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Erbil, northern Iraq, and at “anti-Iran terror groups” in Syria.
  





      Iran said the strikes in Iraq were in response to what it said were Israeli attacks that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders, and claimed targets in Syria were involved in the recent dual bombings in the city of Kerman during a memorial for the slain Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani that left scores dead and wounded.
  

      It defended the strikes as a “precise and targeted” operation to deter security threats, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Tuesday.
  

      Iran’s attacks will further raise fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a full-scale war in the Middle East with grave humanitarian, political and economic consequences.
  

      The attacks in Iraq and Syria were condemned by the United States as “reckless” and imprecise, while the United Nations said, “security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.”
  

      Iraq said it submitted a complaint to the UN Security Council and the UN on Tuesday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said there are no Mossad-affiliated centers operating in Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
  

      But, speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at Davos, Iran’s Foreign Minister repeated the country’s claim that the strike on Iraq was a response “against elements and agents of Mossad,” and said Iran has “very good relations” with both Iraq and Pakistan.
  

      “We have talked and agreed for several times on the necessity of fighting terrorism,” he said, adding that the action taken by Iran “targeted Israel that remains a common enemy of both of us,” and that the country would respond to any attack “vigorously.”
  

      He stressed that if Israel’s war in Gaza ends, then other conflicts across the Middle East would too. “If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
  

    Concerns of an escalating war


      Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks has killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, and wrought widespread devastation, as civilians live with the threat of imminent death – either by an airstrike, starvation or disease.
  

      The conflict has escalated hostilities across the region, with Iran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – launching attacks on Israeli forces and its allies.
  

      On Tuesday, the US military launched new strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles controlled by the Iran-backed rebel group, a defense official told CNN.
  

      A few hours later, the Houthis launched a missile into international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, hitting the M/V Zografia, a Maltese flagged bulk carrier, the official said.
  

      The strikes are at least the third round of attacks the US military has launched against the Houthis’ infrastructure since last Thursday, when American and British conducted a joint operation that targeted command and control nodes and weapons depots used by the Houthis to launch missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
  

      US troops in Iraq and Syria have also repeatedly come under rocket and drone attacks from Tehran’s proxies. Last week, the US carried out a strike in Baghdad that killed a leader from an Iran-backed proxy group that Washington blamed for attacks against US personnel in the region.
  

      And fighting has intensified between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah, across the Lebanon border. On Sunday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed to press on with confrontations with Israeli forces on the Lebanon border until the end of the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
  

Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
  

      Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
  

      Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
  

      It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
  

      “It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
  

      Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
  

      “Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
  

      She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
  

      China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”

Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base




      The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.

      The Israeli soldiers stand rifles in hand, arm over shoulder, speaking to the camera. Behind them is the shell of a Gazan building.
  

      “We are here adding light after the black sabbath that the people of Israel had,” one of the men says in the video, circulating on Telegram. “We are occupying, deporting, and settling. Occupying, deporting, and settling. Did you hear that Bibi? Occupying, deporting, and settling.”
  

      As Israel’s war against Hamas enters its fourth month, the Israeli government has said little of substance, at least in any official way, on its plans for post-war Gaza.
  

      Hamas seized control of the territory – home to about 2.2 million Palestinians – from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, two years after Israel unilaterally withdrew all its troops and about 8,000 Jewish settlers. Who governs it after Israel’s war against Hamas concludes is an open question.
  






A photograph shows soldiers posing with an orange banner that reads: “Only settlement would be considered victory!” The color orange was used by the settler movement in 2004 and 2005 to protest Israel’s disengagement from Gaza.

Social Media



      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea of establishing Jewish settlements, but has said only that neither Hamas nor the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority should govern the territory, and that Israel will keep “full security control.”
  

      Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, has released his own proposal, saying that there should be “no Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip,” but light on detail about what governance there would look like.
  

      Into that void has stepped a group – once fringe, but now in the governing coalition –that hopes for full Israeli control, to resettle Gaza and even expel Palestinians. And its ideas are permeating mainstream debate.
  

      “We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of the residents of Gaza,” far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on January 1.
  

      Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, says that Israel “will rule there. And in order to rule there securely for a long time, we must have a civilian presence.”
  

      The United States’ top diplomat is concerned enough that he has publicly rebuked those plans.
  

      “These statements are irresponsible, they’re inflammatory, and they only make it harder to secure a future of Palestinian-led Gaza with Hamas no longer in control, and with terrorist groups no longer able to threaten Israel’s security,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a recent trip to Qatar.
  

      Polling in Israel on the question of re-establishing settlements varies widely, reflecting subtleties in how the question is asked, and the fact that public opinion in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack is wildly in flux, says Dahlia Scheindlin, a polling expert, journalist, and contributor to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

      “The general range goes from about 25% who want to re-establish permanent communities, Jewish Israeli communities in Gaza, to somewhere in the 40% range,” she told CNN of several polls conducted in November and December. “That is not a small portion of Israeli society.”
  

      There is also an established track record in Israel of politicians pushing seemingly extremist ideas into mainstream conversation, and even into law. Netanyahu last year supported an effort started by a right-wing minister from his own Likud party to push through a law limiting the Supreme Court’s ability to scrutinize legislation, despite months of protests that roiled the nation. That proposal never had majority support, but the Knesset nonetheless passed it into law. The Supreme Court struck down the proposal earlier this month, saying it would deal a “severe and unprecedented blow to the core characteristics of the State of Israel as a democratic state.”
  

      “Ideas that often seem very extreme at a certain phase in Israel’s history can over time become increasingly normalized very incrementally – sometimes a little bit below the radar, not exactly hidden, but not exactly advertised,” Scheindlin said of Israeli policymaking.
  

      Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer who has served as an adviser to the Palestinian Authority, gives little credence to Netanyahu’s professed opposition to re-establishing settlements in Gaza.
  

      “As much as Netanyahu may say that he’s not going to do it, he will ultimately,” she told CNN. “Because we as Palestinians have long learned that they end up finding some sort of excuse – you know, the coalition needs to stay together, whatever. And Palestinians always pay the price for it.”
  

    People are ‘waking up’


      Far from a new idea, the desire to re-settle Gaza comes from decades of frustration with then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s 2004 decision to dismantle 21 Israel settlements in Gaza – known as Gush Katif – and expel their 8,000 Jewish residents, a process which was completed in 2005.
  

      Settler activists like Yishai Fleisher, a spokesman for Jewish settlers in Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, sense an opportunity.
  

      “For people like myself who are on the so-called Israeli right, who have been warning about this situation for years, who protested the 2005 disengagement, nothing has changed,” Fleisher told CNN. “October 7 was just proof for what we’ve been saying all along.”
  

      As a protester, in 2005, Fleisher was among those ejected from Gaza by the Israeli government. With public opinion in flux, he hopes that his movement’s moment has come.

Israeli government divisions burst into open as ministers ‘fight’ over post-war plans




      “People are waking up – they’re trying to open their minds,” he said of fellow Israelis, reevaluating their politics in the wake of October 7.
  

      If Palestinians in Gaza are “post-Jihad, pro-Israel, and want to live that good life in that beautiful soil, there should be an opportunity for that,” he said. “Anti-Israel, pro-jihad Arabs have got to leave. And they’re going to have to find a different place to go. It might be Turkey, and it might be Jordan, and it might be South America,” he said. “If they can’t muster in their heart to live in or next to the Jewish state, we can’t have them.”
  

      The Norwegian Refugee Council in December warned that “any attempts by Israel to deport and permanently displace Palestinians within and from Gaza would constitute a serious breach of international law and an atrocity crime.”
  

      Since October 7, about 85% of Gaza’s population, or some 1.9 million people, have been displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations – many of them moved multiple times, fleeing airstrikes and heeding Israeli warnings of military attacks, and largely squeezed into a small, southwestern corner of the territory.
  

      Israel was last week accused of genocide in Gaza by South Africa, whose lawyers argued at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that Israel’s military campaign was intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.” Israel strenuously denied the accusation and said that the charge was “a concerted and cynical effort to pervert the meaning of the term ‘genocide’ itself.”
  

    Humanitarian framing


      At the Gush Katif museum in Jerusalem, former settlers are printing T-shirts in bright orange. That color was adopted in 2004 and 2005 by the movement protesting Israel’s disengagement from Gaza. At the time, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers pulled settlers from settlement synagogues. Days later, Palestinian forces razed the buildings to the ground.
  

      “Home, returning to Gush Katif,” the slogan on the T-shirts reads.
  

      The movement to re-establish Gush Katif, has found a place, too, among some of the many (IDF) soldiers posting from Gaza on social media.
  

      A photograph from a ruined Gaza street shows two soldiers holding an Israeli flag, altered to include an orange stripe and the words, in Hebrew: “Coming home!”
  

      Another photograph shows soldiers with an orange banner that reads: “Only settlement would be considered victory!”

      Those advocating for renewed Israeli settlements often frame their arguments in humanitarian terms, arguing that Palestinians would have a better life elsewhere.
  

      “This is a correct, just, moral and humane solution,” said Ben Gvir, who has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism.
  

      Gila Gamliel, Israel’s intelligence minister and a member of Likud, suggested in November that Israel “promote the voluntary resettlement of Palestinians in Gaza, for humanitarian reasons, outside of the Strip.”
  

      Fleisher, too, told CNN: “I would want to leave if I was in a war zone with children.”
  

      Between 68% and 81% of buildings in northern Gaza have been damaged by Israel’s war in Gaza, according to analysis of satellite imagery up to January 5 by researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York. In all of Gaza, the figure is between 45% and 56%.
  

    ‘Ethnic cleansing’


      Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, has made clear his government’s “complete rejection of the displacement of any Palestinian citizen.”
  

      However, the vision of voluntary emigration could “become true by default,” Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born professor of holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, told CNN.
  

      “Can the population now return to northern Gaza, which has largely been destroyed?”
  

      “As a result of this, there is an opening for those ministers, media people, and so forth on the Israeli right to say, ‘Well the most humanitarian solution is to remove that population’ — or to encourage, as they say — to move out of Gaza. If that happens, then this entire scenario that I’m talking about will be seen as ethnic cleansing.”
  

      Buttu, who said she has little doubt about the determination of some in Israel to re-settle Gaza based on their settlement efforts in the West Bank, voiced a similar concern.
  

      Israel has “created the conditions whereby Gaza is no longer liveable,” she said. “Now they’re just simply repacking it as some sort of humanitarian gift, or humanitarian solution, when really what it is, is aiding Israel and ethnically cleansing Gaza of Palestinians.”
  

      Netanyahu has rejected the idea of new settlements as “unrealistic,” saying in an English-language statement that “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”
  

      In October, the Israeli government admitted that a leaked intelligence document proposing the relocation of millions of Palestinian Gazans to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula was genuine, but downplayed its significance as “a preliminary paper, like dozens of such papers prepared by all political and security echelons.”
  

      Nonetheless, the fact the re-settlement movement is now being openly discussed in Israel’s parliament, or Knesset, as it was during a committee hearing earlier this month, is a step-change in the debate. And despite international opprobrium, its far-right proponents are not holding back.
  

      “We first need to occupy, to annex, to destroy all the houses there, build neighborhoods there,” Tzvi Sukkot, a member of Knesset from Smotrich’s Religious Zionism said during the committee hearing.
  

      The only image that will convince Israel’s enemy of its defeat, said Limor Son Har Melech from Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power Party, to applause, is “the settlement, and Jewish children walking in its streets.”"

      It is unfortunate that instead of having a serious debate about the causes of the war, the issue has been co-opted by partisans on the left and the right to pursue their long-standing conflict over identity politics and cancel culture.
  

      The United States needs a serious and reasoned discussion about how to resolve the conflict in Gaza. The US is a key player: the only one that has any leverage over the government of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Institutions of higher learning, where students, faculty and staff alike are invested in the mission of academic freedom, should be fertile ground for fostering such robust discourse.
  

      On most American campuses, however, there is no real debate about the war. Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who “Stand with Israel” and those seeking “Justice for Palestine.”

Opinion: Psychology explains why the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is so intractable




      This bifurcation is understandable, given the trauma experienced by both sides in the conflict and increasingly visible in images and accounts from the region. But it is alarming to see the gulf that separates the two narratives widening among Americans.
  

      While most Americans support Israel, polls show that a majority of young Americans, including many college students, are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. For them, the Holocaust is ancient history, while they see the harrowing deaths of Palestinians in real time on their social media feeds.
  

      Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.
  

      The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.

Opinion: The conversation we can’t avoid about pro-Palestinian campus protests




      It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority. The Palestinians are vastly outmatched by the powerful Israeli security forces, but Israel lives in the shadow of the Holocaust and is outnumbered 50 to one by its Arab neighbors across the wider region.
  

      The Palestinian side starts the historical clock with the 1917 Balfour Declaration, when the British foreign minister promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine. Or they go back to the founding of Israel in 1948 and the nakba, the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians.
  

      For Jews, history does not begin in 1948, or 1917. Zionism was not a product of the British empire. It was born in Vienna, Vilnius and Lviv. It was a response to the realization that there was no place for Jews, assimilated or not, in the Austrian and Russian empires. The word pogrom comes from Russian and entered the English language in the late 19th century with reports of state-sponsored killing of Jews in the Russian empire. The word genocide was coined during World War II by Raphael Lemkin, a Jew from Galicia, where more than 100,000 Jews were killed in pogroms in 1921.

Opinion: I thought I’d be safe from antisemitism at my college. I was wrong




      The founding of Israel should also be seen in the context of state-building and ethnic cleaning throughout the region. Alongside the Palestinians expelled from Israel, there were 900,000 Jews driven from their homes in Arab lands in the mid-20th century. As recently as 1991, 14,000 Ethiopian Jews, fleeing famine, were evacuated to Israel. Egypt and Jordan occupied Gaza and the West Bank, respectively, from 1948 to 1967 and were indifferent to Palestinians’ rights.
  

      Another problem with the settler colonialism narrative is that it treats each side as a monolithic actor, playing the role of colonizer and victim, respectively. In reality there is a diversity of ideas and interests in both the Israeli and Palestinian camps.
  

      The tragedy of the past 30 years is that moderates on both sides, interested in making a genuine peace, have been repeatedly outflanked by radicals screaming that compromise means betrayal. This process of “ethnic outbidding” can be seen in many conflicts, from Bosnia to Northern Ireland.

Opinion: Netanyahu’s reckoning comes after the war. That’s a dangerous timeline




      For years, Netanyahu has obstructed efforts to forge a compromise peace with the Palestinians. He actually helped Hamas after the group came to power in Gaza, because that meant the Palestinians were divided and unable to make peace with Israel. However, Israel cannot achieve security through military means alone.
  

      Hamas started the war on October 7 to undermine Israel’s image in the world and deter other Arab states such as Saudi Arabia from following the example of the 2020 Abraham Accords, in which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan made peace with Israel. The pro-Palestinian left on American campuses seems to oppose Israel making peace with its neighbors on the grounds that it is not connected to the creation of a Palestinian state. I was shocked to hear a Palestinian professor argue in a Zoom lecture that the more civilians that are martyred by Israel, the closer they will be to liberation.
  

      The Hamas strategy seems to be working, with mounting global condemnation of Israel’s assault on Gaza and a surge in support for Hamas among Palestinians.
  

      Hamas gets support from Iran, Turkey and Qatar. But the moderate Arab countries fear Hamas more than they fear Israel. That’s why the Arab League was unable to come up with a joint statement at its October 21 meeting in Cairo.

      None of this is to excuse the mass killing of civilians in Gaza or the occupation regime in the West Bank — a literal case of settler colonialism. But peace will only be possible if we recognize that there are legitimate grievances on both sides. It is not a struggle between right and wrong, between good and evil, though partisans often frame it in those terms.
  

      The United States has a vital role to play. It is the only actor with the ability to force Netanyahu to de-escalate, as it has done repeatedly in past wars fought by Israel. At the same time, it is working with its Arab allies to come up with a solution that enables Israelis and Palestinians to coexist in peace.
  

      Students and faculty on American universities should be working together to help forge a solution, and not using the conflict to open a new front in the culture wars and to score points against their political opponents in the US."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/politics/takeaways-town-hall-ron-desantis/index.html,Takeaways from CNN’s New Hampshire town hall with Ron DeSantis,"CNN
         — 
    


      Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a CNN town hall Tuesday night that Republicans are “going to lose” the 2024 election if they nominate former President Donald Trump.
  

      The day after finishing a distant second to Trump – though just ahead of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley – in Iowa’s caucuses, the Florida governor fielded questions in New Hampshire at a town hall moderated by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.
  

      He used the event to make the case that with a conservative policy record, he would be better able than Haley to consolidate Republican support; and with less personal baggage, he’d be better positioned than Trump to win a general election.
  

      “If Donald Trump is the nominee, the election will revolve around all these legal issues,” DeSantis said.
  

      “We’re going to lose if that’s the decision voters are making based on that. We don’t want it to be a referendum on those issues,” he said. “We want it to be a referendum on the country going in the wrong direction and a candidate like me being a president who could reverse the decline.”
  

      That message was the same one DeSantis has emphasized on the campaign trail in recent weeks. He didn’t launch any new attacks on Haley and Trump but did seek to make clear he remains a factor in the race. 


      Here are five takeaways from DeSantis’ town hall:

    DeSantis tries a go-everywhere, do-everything strategy


      Trump won’t debate his Republican rivals. And, as of Tuesday morning, Haley says she won’t either, unless the former president shows up. That led ABC News to cancel plans for a Thursday night face-off, and it could spell the end of the 2024 GOP primary debates.
  

      But DeSantis wanted to make sure New Hampshire voters knew it wasn’t his fault — he had been up for it.
  

      “I’m the only candidate that actually agreed to come to New Hampshire to debate,” he said. “I’m the only one who’s not running a basement campaign at this point.”

      His comments demonstrated how DeSantis is looking for every possible opportunity to break through.
  

      He visited South Carolina earlier Tuesday before continuing on to New Hampshire. Why? As DeSantis explained it, his team wasn’t sure what the weather would be like in the Granite State, and he didn’t want to waste any time.
  

      He also knocked Haley for failing to compete in the party-run Nevada caucuses, where on February 8, only Trump, DeSantis and little-known Dallas pastor Ryan Binkley are on the ballot. (Haley is competing in the state-run primary, but delegates to the national GOP convention will be awarded based on the caucus results.)

      “I’m competing for delegates. And yes, the party went to a caucus to try to rig it for Trump,” he said, referring to the Nevada Republican Party’s decision to run its own caucuses. “But you know, as Republicans, it’s not always going to be fair for us.”
  

      There is some irony in DeSantis’ go-everywhere, do-everything strategy. He began his campaign largely ignoring and sidestepping mainstream media. That’s changed now that the Florida governor has little to lose — unlike Trump, who won the Iowa caucuses by a record-setting margin, and Haley, who polls suggest is battling Trump for first place in New Hampshire with DeSantis in a distant third.
  

      But his performances have demonstrated how comfortable a once-shaky DeSantis has grown with formats such as televised town halls.
  

      “You deserve, as a voter, to have the candidates come up, answer your questions in forums like this, have somebody like Wolf (Blitzer) moderate a debate where you go back and forth,” he said Tuesday night.
  






DeSantis answers a question during the town hall in New Hampshire on January 16, 2024.

Will Lanzoni/CNN



    DeSantis questions Haley’s ability to unite Republicans


      DeSantis offered a simple message about Haley: She cannot unite the GOP and win the nomination.
  

      Within that soundbite, though, was some insight into how he views the next stage of this race. It’s a clear appeal to the Never Trump voters who could decide the New Hampshire primary. DeSantis is, in effect, saying that if you do not want to nominate Trump, then he’s the guy people should support.
  

      He also jabbed Haley for refusing to take part in any future debates, lumping her in with President Joe Biden and Trump as candidates running from their “basements.”
  

      DeSantis acknowledged the need to make a wider political appeal – itself a departure from his earlier campaign strategy – and talked up his election record in Florida, where his victories have come with some support from Democrats.
  

      “I think it’s great in a general election to build a big tent,” DeSantis said, “but to win a Republican primary … you gotta be able to win core Republicans, you gotta be able to win conservatives, and she can’t do that.”
  

      He tried to underline the point by saying that a number of Trump supporters in Iowa had told him that they liked him and would have backed him if the former president hadn’t also been on the ballot.
  

      Haley, he insisted, is not a realistic second choice for Trump voters.
  

      “She does not have the ability to win the kind of coalition that you need to win a Republican primary – period, much less take on Donald Trump,” DeSantis said.
  






The town hall was held at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire.

    ‘The US is not a racist country’


      DeSantis was asked if he agreed with comments Haley had made earlier in the day, when she said that the United States has “never been a racist country.”
  

      “The US is not a racist country,” the Florida governor said, while noting that “we’ve overcome things in our history.”
  

      DeSantis made fighting “woke-ism,” including education around race, a core part of his early national profile. He faced waves of criticism over Florida’s efforts to limit teaching about racism in schools, from his pushback against the College Board over its Advanced Placement course on African American studies to how the state’s curriculum teaches about slavery.
  

      DeSantis said Tuesday night that, in his view, the Republican Party stands for “merit and achievement and colorblindness,” and highlighted his efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Florida. In May last year, he signed legislation to defund DEI programs at Florida public schools.
  

      “They say it’s diversity, equity and inclusion, but it’s really very ideological, and they’re trying to impose an agenda,” he said. “I think the way it’s actually practiced, it stands for discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination, and it’s wrong.”
  

      Asked to clarify if he thought the US had ever been a racist country, DeSantis said the country has had “challenges with how we’ve dealt with race.” He pointed to the Supreme Court’s infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision – in which the justices ruled that Black Americans could not be US citizens. The ruling was later nullified by the 14th Amendment.
  

      Haley was asked during a Fox News appearance Tuesday if she thought her party was racist after MSNBC’s Joy Reid questioned whether she, as a woman of color, could win the GOP nomination. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, referenced the country as a whole in her answer.
  

      “We’ve never been a racist country,” she said. “Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can.”
  

    DeSantis warns of Trump’s legal liabilities


      DeSantis continued his warnings that Trump’s legal issues will follow him throughout the campaign.
  

      “If Donald Trump is the nominee, the election will revolve around all these legal issues, his trials, perhaps convictions if he goes to trials and loses there and about things like January 6,” DeSantis said. “We’re going to lose if voters are making a decision based on that. We don’t want it to be a referendum on those issues. We want it to be a referendum on the country going in the wrong direction and a candidate like me being a president that can reverse the decline.”
  

      Still, it’s notable that just a day after Trump’s resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses, DeSantis devoted less than a total of five minutes to discussing the former president by name.
  

      He mentioned Trump’s lack of participation in the primary debates, acknowledged how his support
  

      for the former president from his days as a congressman changed over time and hit Trump over Covid-19.
  

      But overall, DeSantis clearly refrained from devoting too much of this town hall to the GOP front-runner.
  

    DeSantis loosens up


      DeSantis sought to connect with town hall attendees in more personal ways Tuesday night.
  

      He talked about growing up in the 1990s and playing baseball — “It was like a holiday from history” that changed on September 11, 2001, he said.
  

      He asked a woman who posed a question about mental health if she had any advice.
  

      The looser, gentler DeSantis onstage in New Hampshire looked like a much different candidate than the one who entered the presidential race with a reputation as a brawler in Florida.
  

      “I don’t take the politics personally. People attack me — that’s just the price of doing business,” he said.
  

      That comment would’ve raised eyebrows back home in Florida when DeSantis was embroiled in a fight with Disney and revoked the company’s decades-old self-governance privileges around its Orlando-area theme parks after it criticized a state law banning certain classroom instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity.
  

      Though it might be too little, too late, DeSantis has in recent months altered what started as a pugnacious approach and culture war-focused message. On Tuesday night, he stressed the nation’s need to “be able to have disagreements.”

      “If Donald Trump is the nominee, the election will revolve around all these legal issues, his trials, perhaps convictions if he goes to trials and loses there and about things like January 6,” DeSantis said. “We’re going to lose if voters are making a decision based on that. We don’t want it to be a referendum on those issues. We want it to be a referendum on the country going in the wrong direction and a candidate like me being a president that can reverse the decline.”
  

      Still, it’s notable that just a day after Trump’s resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses, DeSantis devoted less than a total of five minutes to discussing the former president by name.
  

      He mentioned Trump’s lack of participation in the primary debates, acknowledged how his support
  

      for the former president from his days as a congressman changed over time and hit Trump over Covid-19.
  

      But overall, DeSantis clearly refrained from devoting too much of this town hall to the GOP front-runner.
  

    DeSantis loosens up


      DeSantis sought to connect with town hall attendees in more personal ways Tuesday night.
  

      He talked about growing up in the 1990s and playing baseball — “It was like a holiday from history” that changed on September 11, 2001, he said.
  

      He asked a woman who posed a question about mental health if she had any advice.
  

      The looser, gentler DeSantis onstage in New Hampshire looked like a much different candidate than the one who entered the presidential race with a reputation as a brawler in Florida.
  

      “I don’t take the politics personally. People attack me — that’s just the price of doing business,” he said.
  

      That comment would’ve raised eyebrows back home in Florida when DeSantis was embroiled in a fight with Disney and revoked the company’s decades-old self-governance privileges around its Orlando-area theme parks after it criticized a state law banning certain classroom instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity.
  

      Though it might be too little, too late, DeSantis has in recent months altered what started as a pugnacious approach and culture war-focused message. On Tuesday night, he stressed the nation’s need to “be able to have disagreements.”

         — 
    


      Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday went after Nikki Haley while referring to her by her first name, Nimarata, in the latest example of Trump using racist dog whistles to attack his GOP presidential rival.
  

      Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She took her husband Michael Haley’s last name after they married.
  

      Trump misspelled Nimarata as “Nimrada” as he attacked her in a new post on his social media platform Truth Social.
  

      “Anyone listening to Nikki ‘Nimrada’ Haley’s wacked out speech last night, would think that she won the Iowa Primary. She didn’t, and she couldn’t even beat a very flawed Ron DeSanctimonious, who’s out of money, and out of hope,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
  

      Trump also recently amplified a post that falsely claimed Haley was ineligible to run for president because her parents were not US citizens at the time of her birth. Haley was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, and is a US citizen.
  

      The attacks echo Trump’s smears against former President Barack Obama. Trump was a chief promoter of the racist lie that Obama was not born in the US and ineligible to be president. Trump also regularly emphasizes Obama’s middle name, Hussein, at campaign rallies.
  

      Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race on Monday and endorsed Trump, has also tried to attack Haley over her given name.
  

      Haley responded to the attacks from Ramaswamy in a Fox News interview, saying, “First of all, I was born with Nikki on my birth certificate, I was raised as Nikki, I married a Haley, and so that is what my name is, so he can say or misspell or do whatever he wants.”

      Erosion has carved huge arches and cavernous hollows into the world’s largest iceberg as it floats through the ocean away from Antarctica, spectacular new photos show.
  

      The images were captured by photographers aboard a vessel run by the company EYOS Expeditions, which has been cruising along a section of the A23a iceberg.
  

      The photos reveal the vast scale of the iceberg — which is more than twice the size of the UK capital, London — as it stretches off into the distance.
  

      The images show the deep surface cracks, as well as hollowed out caves, carved into the iceberg.
  

      The A23a iceberg is being gradually eroded as it moves further north of Antarctica and encounters milder air and warmer ocean temperatures.
  

      The expedition team witnessed chunks of the iceberg break off into the sea, an EYOS Expeditions spokesman told CNN.
  

      A23a is on the move after nearly three decades of being grounded on the seafloor in Antarctica. The huge mass of ice broke away from the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in 1986, calved and grounded on the Antarctic’s Weddell Sea floor almost immediately.

      The iceberg is about 400 meters (1,312 feet) thick, and almost 4,000 square kilometers (1,544 square miles) in area. That’s more than three times the size of Los Angeles.

      A23a has held the “largest current iceberg” title several times since the 1980s, occasionally being surpassed by larger but shorter-lived icebergs, including A68 in 2017 and A76 in 2021.
  

      The enormous iceberg will eventually disappear completely.
  

      Scientists have said that, while this particular iceberg likely broke away as part of the natural growth cycle of the ice shelf, climate change is driving worrying changes in this vast, isolated continent with potentially devastating consequences for global sea level rise.
  

      Last February, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent since records began, at 691,000 square miles.

      At least 10 people have died following an explosion at a fireworks depot in central Thailand, according to officials.
  

      It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, which happened at around 4 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Wednesday in Suphan Buri province, north of Thailand’s capital Bangkok, local police said.
  

      “We estimated there are about 10 deaths, we are still investigating the cause and the exact number of casualties,” Police Colonel Peerapoj Rawangbarn told CNN.
  

      Police said the fire around the area had now been put out, and that rescue workers and forensic officers were working to retrieve human remains from and around the demolished factory.

Hong Kong

         — 
    


      China reported a record low birth rate in 2023 as its population shrank for the second year in a row. The trend marked the deepening of a demographic challenge set to have significant implications on the world’s second largest economy.
  

      The country recorded 6.39 births per 1,000 people, down from 6.77 a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Wednesday. The birth rate is the lowest since the founding of Communist China in 1949.
  

      Some 9.02 million babies were born, compared with 9.56 million babies in 2022. The overall population fell in 2023 to 1.409 billion, down 2.08 million people from the previous year, the bureau said.
  

      “To be sure, last year’s sharp decline should be partly due to the lockdowns and most likely new births will rebound in 2024, although the structural down-trend remains unchanged,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group.
  

      The country’s demographic shift comes at a time when its growth is sputtering. The NBS confirmed that China’s economy grew by 5.2% last year, compared to a government target of around 5%.
  

      While this expansion marks a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s worst economic performances in over three decades.
  

      Chinese stocks tumbled on Wednesday following the data release. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 4.1% by mid-afternoon, heading towards its lowest closing level since October 2022. The CSI300, which consists of 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell 2.2%. Both indexes had a dismal year in 2023, down more than 10% each.
  

      China has been beset by a series of economic problems, including investor exodus and deflation. The shrinking population will now force Beijing to make some structural changes in its economy and reshape sectors including health care and housing.
  

      Wednesday’s data wasn’t entirely gloomy. In the fourth quarter, China’s GDP expanded 5.2%, accelerating from the third quarter’s 4.9% growth. However, this boost may not be long-term, experts said.
  

      “There are two key drivers behind this: the unexpected, but short-lived release of pent-up demand during the [third quarter] holidays, and the low base effect of [fourth quarter] 2022,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of the China Center for Economics and Business at the Conference Board.
  

      He believes China’s GDP growth will decelerate to 4.1% in 2024 because of several significant headwinds to growth, including the ongoing property downturn and subdued consumption.
  

      In December, new home prices fell by the highest amount in nearly nine years, according to a Reuters calculation based on NBS data, and property investment slumped 9.6% in 2023 from the previous year, marking a second straight year of declines.
  

      The latest figures come after China’s population declined for the first time in decades in 2022 in what analysts said was the country’s first drop since the 1961 famine triggered by former leader Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward. Last year, China was surpassed by India as the world’s most populous country.

      The slowing birth rate comes despite a push from the government to encourage more married couples to have children following decades of restrictive birth policies.
  

      “There are fewer people getting married and fewer couples want to have children,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York.
  

      The Covid-19 pandemic also likely affected the existing trend “because of (its) impact on the economy – the economic slowdown, the high unemployment rate among young people – all of that has discouraged people from getting married and having kids,” he said.
  

      The falling birth rate coincides with a shrinking workforce and a rapidly aging population: twin challenges for China’s government as it grapples with funding health care and pensions for elderly citizens, while aiming to maintain growth in an economy manned by fewer people of working age.
  

    The ‘silver economy’


      China’s working population, classified as those between the ages of 16 and 59, declined by 10.75 million last year, adding to an ongoing contraction. The population of those over 60, meanwhile, continued to expand. More than one-fifth of the population, or nearly 297 million people, are now in that age bracket.
  

      China’s top administrative body, the State Council, last week released guidelines to strengthen the so-called “silver economy,” as part of top-down efforts to tackle the challenges of caring for a growing number of elderly.
  

      The guidelines call on companies across sectors including housing, health care and finance to tailor services and products for the elderly. Land development and local government financing should support facilities for aging residents, it added.
  

      The call to grow the “silver economy” follows protests in at least four cities last year, where thousands of elderly took to the streets to protest cuts to monthly medical benefits made as local governments grappled with deficits.
  

      China’s death rate and number of fatalities also rose in 2023 compared with the previous year, according to data released Wednesday. Authorities reported a death rate of 7.87 per thousand people and 11.1 million deaths. In 2022, there were 10.41 million deaths with a death rate of 7.37 per thousand.
  

      Last year, China experienced a major outbreak of Covid-19, with infections sweeping across the country starting in late 2022 following the abrupt relaxation of stringent pandemic controls. Experts say China has not released comprehensive data on fatalities, even as authorities have defended their Covid-19 data transparency.
  

      The increase of 690,000 deaths last year compared with 2022 is “noteworthy” when contrasted with smaller, incremental rises during pre-pandemic years, according to CFR’s Huang.
  

      The comparison highlights a marked escalation in fatalities during the Covid era, he said. However, the latest data “might not fully capture the actual number of Covid-related deaths,” he added, pointing to how the total increase in deaths between this year and last falls short of scientific estimates of fatalities during China’s re-opening.
  

    Return of youth unemployment data


      In a surprise move, the NBS brought back the monthly youth unemployment rate after a five-month hiatus.

China’s economy grew by about 5.2% in 2023, Premier Li says




      In August, the NBS suspended the release of data on joblessness among young people, after the figure hit consecutive record highs around 21% amid a broader economic slump. It said the methodology needed to be improved.
  

      In December, the jobless rate for 16- to 24-year olds stood at 14.9%, it said Wednesday. The figure excluded some 62 million students, whose main task should be “to study” rather than looking for jobs, the NBS said.
  

      It also added a new unemployment category for people in the 25 to 29 age group, which reached 6.1% in December.
  

      The real estate crisis, which is at the heart of many of China’s economic problems, has persisted.
  

      Home sales by square footage fell by 8.5% in 2023, marking the second straight year of decline, and sentiment among investors remained weak.
  

      Property investment slumped 9.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, which was also the second consecutive year of contraction.
  

      The property sector has played an outsized role in the Chinese economy, accounting for as much as 30% of GDP. Housing assets make up about 70%, the biggest proportion, of household wealth.
  

      Land sales to developers had accounted for more than 40% of local government income in the years before 2021. The sector fell into crisis about three years ago after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing.
  

      Due to the aging population, analysts widely expect housing demand to wane in the coming years, which will drag down the property industry and affect growth prospects.
  

      There were some other bright spots in Wednesday’s data though.
  

      Industrial production jumped 6.8% in December, which was better than expectations. It was the fastest growth since February 2022. For 2023, factory output rose 4.6%, faster than 2022’s 3.6% increase.
  

      Fixed-asset investment also came in above market forecasts, up 3% in December from a year earlier.
  

      Retail sales increased 7.4% in 2023, reversing the 0.2% drop in 2022. But December retail sales rose 7.4% from a year ago, missing expectations of 8% growth. That slowdown was mostly driven by slower growth in car and medicine sales.
  

      The mixed data point to the need for more stimulus measures from the government, analysts said.
  

      “Policy easing will continue to be desperately needed to ensure the economic recovery is secured in 2024,” said Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP, a Swiss private bank.

      Meet Retro, a cloned rhesus monkey born on July 16, 2020.
  

      He is now more than 3 years old and is “doing well and growing strong,” according to Falong Lu, one of the authors of a study published in the journal Nature Communications Tuesday that describes how Retro came to be.
  

      Retro is only the second species of primate that scientists have been able to clone successfully. The same team of researchers announced in 2018 that they had made two identical cloned cynomolgus monkeys (a type of macaque), which are still alive today.
  

      “We have achieved the first live and healthy cloned rhesus monkey, which is a big step forward that has turned impossible to possible, although the efficiency is very low compared to normal fertilized embryos,” said Lu, an investigator at the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology and Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. “Currently, we haven’t had the second live birth yet.”

Scientists create chimeric monkey with two sets of DNA




      The first mammal to be cloned — Dolly the sheep — was created in 1996 using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, where scientists essentially reconstruct an unfertilized egg by fusing a somatic cell nucleus (not from a sperm or egg) with an egg in which the nucleus has been removed.
  

      Since then, scientists have cloned many mammalian species, including pigs, cows, horses and dogs, but the process has been hit or miss, with typically only a tiny percentage of the embryos that are transferred into surrogates resulting in viable offspring.
  

      “In a way we have made much progress in that, after Dolly, many mammalian species were cloned, but the truth is that inefficiency remains a major roadblock,” said Miguel Esteban, principal investigator with the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was not involved in the latest research but has collaborated with some members of the research team on other primate studies.
  

    Cloning a rhesus monkey


      The Chinese team, based in Shanghai and Beijing, used a modified version of SCNT in their work on cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and tweaked the technique further to clone the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).
  

      During hundreds of failed cloning attempts, they realized that, in the early cloned embryos, the outer membrane that forms the placenta did not develop properly. To address this problem, they performed a process called inner cell mass transplantation, which involved putting cloned inner cells into a non-cloned embryo, and that allowed the clone to develop normally, Esteban explained.

Scientists create mice from two dads after making eggs from skin cells




      The team then tested the new technique using 113 reconstructed embryos, 11 of which were transferred to seven surrogates, resulting in only one live birth, according to the study.
  

      “We think that there might be additional…. abnormalities to be fixed. Strategies to further enhance the success rate of SCNT in primates remains …our main focus in the future,” Lu said
  

      The first two cloned monkeys, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, are now more than 6 years old and live a “happy and healthy life” with others of the same species. Lu said thus far the researchers have not identified any potential limits on the cloned monkeys’ lifespan.
  

      Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are usually described as the first cloned monkeys. However, a rhesus monkey was cloned in 1999 using what researchers consider a simpler cloning method. In that case, scientists split the embryos, much like what happens naturally when identical twins develop, rather than using an adult cell like with the SCNT technique.
  

     The implications of cloning monkeys


      The researchers said that being able to successfully clone monkeys might help accelerate biomedical research given that there are limitations on what scientists can learn from lab mice. Research on nonhuman primates, which are closer to humans, has been pivotal to lifesaving medical advances, including the creation of vaccines against Covid-19, according to a report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released in May.
  

      The use of monkeys in scientific research is a contentious issue because of ethical concerns about animal welfare. The team said it followed Chinese laws and guidelines governing the use of nonhuman primates in scientific research.
  

      The UK’s Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it has “serious ethical and welfare concerns around the application of cloning technology to animals. Cloning animals requires procedures that can cause pain and distress, and there can be high failure and mortality rates.”
  

      Being able to produce genetically identical monkeys could be useful, Esteban said.
  

      “This research is proof of principle that cloning can be done in different non-human primate species and opens the door to new ways of enhancing the efficiency. Cloned monkeys can be genetically engineered in complex ways that wild-type monkeys cannot; this has many implications for disease modeling. There is also a species conservation perspective,” he added.
  

      Dr Lluís Montoliu, research scientist at the National Center for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC) in Spain who wasn’t involved in the research, said that cloning both species of monkey demonstrated two things.
  

      “First, it is possible to clone primates. And second, no less important, it is extremely difficult to succeed with these experiments, with such low efficiencies,” he said in a statement.
  

      He added that the low success rate of the process showed that “not only was human cloning unnecessary and debatable, but if attempted, it would be extraordinarily difficult and ethically unjustifiable.”
  

      “Reproductive cloning a human being is completely unacceptable,” Lu said."

      A Korean Air plane clipped wings with a Cathay Pacific jet at an airport in Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido on Tuesday amid heavy snow – an incident that comes just weeks after a fatal aircraft collision in Tokyo.
  

      No injuries were reported in the collision at Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport (CTS), which occurred around 5:30 p.m., according to the airport operator. The Korean Air jet had 289 passengers and crew on board, the Chitose Fire Department told CNN, while the Cathay Pacific plane was empty.
  

      Airport safety issues have been under scrutiny in Japan following a fatal collision at Tokyo’s busy Haneda airport on January 2 when a Japan Airlines jet burst into flames after hitting a coast guard plane.
  

      On Tuesday, both airlines confirmed the incident on social media, with Korean Air saying one of its aircraft “came into contact” with the Cathay plane during pushback, adding it was “cooperating with all relevant authorities.”
  

      Cathay Pacific said its plane “was stationary at the time with no customers nor crew onboard” when it was “struck by a Korean Air A330 which was taxiing past.”
  

      Cathay flight 583 from Sapporo to Hong Kong was canceled, with the Hong Kong-based carrier saying passengers would be picked up by additional flights later in the day and on the following day. There are two flights flying the same route on Wednesday.
  






The incident happened under snowy conditions.

         — 
    


      Mirra Andreeva, tennis’ new teenage sensation, shocked Ons Jabeur in the second round of the Australian Open on Wednesday.
  

      The 16-year-old beat the No. 6 seed and three-time grand slam finalist 6-0 6-2 for her first career top-10 victory as she continues to show why she’s tipped for the top of the sport.
  

      Afterwards, the 47th-ranked Russian was full of respect for Jabeur and detailed how she has become a personal inspiration of hers.
  

      “It was one of my dreams to play against her because I really like the way she plays,” she told reporters afterwards. “As I said before, I’m inspired by her, so it means a lot. Today, it meant a lot, this match that I won.
  

      Andreeva added that she saw Jabeur as an idol because of “the way she’s on the court and off the court. She’s so nice.”
  

      “Now, after the match, she came to me, she wished me luck. I just know that she is who she is and she never changes. That’s what I like about her.”
  

      It took Andreeva just 54 minutes to dispatch Jabeur in Rod Laver Arena, a victory which books her spot in the third round of the Australian Open for the first time in her nascent career. It is the third time she has reached the third round of a grand slam having done so at the French Open and Wimbledon last year.
  

      Although she admitted afterwards that she felt “really nervous” before taking to the court against the Tunisian, Andreeva showed no signs of those nerves.
  

      She dominated from start to finish, facing just one break point across the whole contest as she hit 13 winners and only 10 unforced errors – in contrast, Jabeur totaled 24 unforced errors and just nine winners.

      At age 16 and 263 days, Andreeva became the youngest player in the Open era to claim a 6-0 opening set against a top-10 seed at a grand slam, according to the Australian Open.
  

      According to the Women’s Tennis Association, Andreeva became the second-youngest player in the Open era to concede three games or fewer against a top-10 seed at a grand slam after Jelena Dokic who beat Martina Hingis at Wimbledon in 1999.
  

      The victory came a year after she lost in the final of the girls’ competition to her friend Alina Korneeva.
  

      After the win – which she called “probably the best match” of her young career so far – Andreeva explained how she had to battle back from last year’s disappointment to reach this point.
  

      “Honestly, after I lost the final, I was just super upset. I didn’t think about anything else. For maybe a week, I was just replaying the match in my head, and I was thinking: ‘This, I should have changed this, should have changed that, I should have changed this,’” the teenager said.
  

      “Honestly, after that, after all my complaints to myself, I forgot about this match. I decided to move on. It’s not the most painful loss of my life. I will have, I’m sure, a lot of offensive matches where I may be late in the score and then I lose. Maybe. I hope this will not happen, but I think it will because it’s tennis.
  

      “After that, I just moved on. Today, when I saw that I play on Rod Laver, I said that this time I have to take my chance and I have to win on the big court for the first time, and so I did.”

      Mirra Andreeva, tennis’ new teenage sensation, shocked Ons Jabeur in the second round of the Australian Open on Wednesday.
  

      The 16-year-old beat the No. 6 seed and three-time grand slam finalist 6-0 6-2 for her first career top-10 victory as she continues to show why she’s tipped for the top of the sport.
  

      Afterwards, the 47th-ranked Russian was full of respect for Jabeur and detailed how she has become a personal inspiration of hers.
  

      “It was one of my dreams to play against her because I really like the way she plays,” she told reporters afterwards. “As I said before, I’m inspired by her, so it means a lot. Today, it meant a lot, this match that I won.
  

      Andreeva added that she saw Jabeur as an idol because of “the way she’s on the court and off the court. She’s so nice.”
  

      “Now, after the match, she came to me, she wished me luck. I just know that she is who she is and she never changes. That’s what I like about her.”

CNN
         — 
    


      Japanese brand Uniqlo is suing Shein over claims the Chinese fast-fashion retailer is selling copycats of its viral shoulder bag.
  

      Fast Retailing, the Japanese giant that owns both Uniqlo and Theory, said in a statement that the form of the “imitation products” that Shein is selling “closely resembles” Uniqlo’s Round Mini Shoulder Bag, which went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in 2022 and 2023, to the point of selling out multiple times.
  

      The crescent-shaped bag, worn across the torso and priced at just $20, was so popular it made headlines across global media and was given the top spot on fashion tech firm Lyst’s rankings of the hottest products in the first quarter of 2023.
  

      But the item’s popularity also inspired a wave of knockoff products, prompting Uniqlo to warn on its website that it was investigating alleged copies and could take legal action.
  

      Its lawsuit against Shein was filed in Tokyo on December 28 and named three of the brand’s operators — Roadget Business Pte, Fashion Choice Pte and Shein Japan — according to the Fast Retailing statement.
  

      It demands the “immediate cessation of sales of the imitation products, and compensation for damages incurred by the Company as a result of these sales.”
  

      The statement added that the sale of these counterfeits had “significantly” undermined customers’ confidence in “the quality of the Uniqlo brand and its products,” and that Fast Retailing takes a “resolute stance” against any infringement of its intellectual property.

‘There is no Coco Chanel’: Lawsuit accuses Shein of copyright infringement




      In a statement to CNN, a Shein spokesperson said the company was “currently investigating this matter.”
  

      “Shein respects the intellectual property rights of others and takes all claims of infringement seriously,” it said.
  

      The shoulder bag first began circulating on TikTok in 2022 and continued to blow up in popularity through 2023, with video creators praising its versatility, spaciousness and affordability.
  

      The most viral TikToks about the bag racked up millions of views, ranging from styling tips to “what’s in my bag” videos, unboxings and haul reviews. As of Wednesday, the hashtag #uniqlobag on TikTok has racked up more than 133.2 million views.
  

      In an investor report in the third quarter of 2023, Fast Retailer credited the shoulder bag for sparking “considerable interest on social media” and expanding its customer base among women and younger shoppers.
  

      This isn’t the first time Shein has faced legal action or controversy. Last year, three graphic designers sued the retailer in the US United States over alleged copyright infringement and racketeering, claiming Shein had sold exact copies of their designs.


      At the time, a Shein spokesperson said the company would “vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit and any claims that are without merit.”
  

      And in December, Shein was also sued by its rival Temu, also a Chinese-owned e-commerce site, which alleged Shein had used aggressive and unlawful tactics to thwart competition – the latest development in an ongoing legal fight between the two."

         — 
    


      Tennis player Alexander Zverev is set to face trial later this year after being accused of physical abuse against a woman, according to a spokesperson for the Berlin Criminal Courts.
  

The German is accused of “physically abusing and damaging the health of a woman during an argument in Berlin in May 2020,” according to a court statement from October 31, 2023.
  

      The statement said he had been given a penalty order and fined €450,000 ($478,000) on October 2, 2023. He denied the allegations and lodged an appeal, meaning the case will be heard in a Berlin district court.
  

      The court spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that the trial is set to begin on May 31 and could run across eight days until July 19.
  

      However, the court spokesperson said Zverev does not need to be present at the trial unless Berlin’s Tiergarten district court decides otherwise. If it does, that could potentially impact Zverev playing at the French Open, which runs from May 26 to June 9, and Wimbledon, which is being staged between July 1 and 14.
  

      CNN has asked Zverev’s lawyers whether he intends to be present at the trial but has yet to receive a response.

Alexander Zverev given penalty order and fined $478K by German court over physical abuse allegations against former partner




      The alleged injured party has joined the proceedings as a joint plaintiff, according to the spokesperson.
  

      According to Zverev’s lawyers, the woman is his former partner. The courts have not named the woman, who is widely reported to be the mother of his child.
  

      CNN has reached out to her management team and lawyer for comment but has not heard back.
  

      ”Mr. Zverev rejects the accusation made against him,” Zverev’s lawyer said in a statement last year.
  

      “The allegations made by the complainant, on which the penalty order alone is based, have already been refuted by a forensic medical report by the recognized Berlin forensic physician Prof. Dr. Tsokos, Charite Berlin.”
  

      The statement from Zverev’s lawyer quotes that report, saying “there are considerable inconsistencies that are not comprehensible from a forensic medical point of view.
  

      “Or in other words: it is practically impossible that the facts of the case occurred as alleged by the complainant.”
  

      In January last year, the ATP Tour announced that there would be no disciplinary action taken against Zverev after an investigation found insufficient evidence to substantiate published allegations of abuse in a separate case.
  

      In October 2021, the ATP, the governing body for men’s professional tennis, said it was launching an investigation after domestic abuse allegations were made by another of Zverev’s former girlfriends, Olya Sharypova.
  

      “Based on a lack of reliable evidence and eyewitness reports, in addition to conflicting statements by Sharypova, Zverev and other interviewees, the investigation was unable to substantiate the allegations of abuse,” an ATP statement read.
  

      Zverev, who has been named in the new ATP Player Advisory Council this year, is currently competing at the Australian Open where he has progressed into the second round of the tournament.
  

      He was asked about the case after his first-round win at Melbourne Park, but the German gave a prickly response when he was pushed on it by reporters.
  

      “Why would it not be?” he said, when asked whether it was appropriate that he was on the ATP Player’s council and even still playing on the Tour."

      Drinking a glass or more of 100% fruit juice each day was linked to a small increase in weight in children and adults, according to a new analysis of prior studies.

FDA finalizes limit on how much arsenic can be in apple juice




      “One fundamental problem with juice is quantity; consuming fruit this way makes it so easy to overdose,” said coauthor and leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
  

      “For example, how often do we eat three oranges? Yet, a glass of OJ is about three oranges that can be consumed in a minute or two, and we can go back and have another, and that will add many calories and lead to a spike in blood glucose,” Willett said in an email.
  

      Over time, too much sugar in the blood can lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and other chronic conditions, experts say.
  

      While the study’s conclusions drawn did not show a direct causation, only an association, the findings were “quite valid and match what we see clinically,” said pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Tamara Hannon, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on nutrition, who was not involved with the research.
  

      Due to concerns over the rising rate of childhood obesity and dental cavities, the AAP advises parents and guardians to avoid juice entirely for babies younger than 1 year old, limit intake to 4 ounces a day for children ages 1 to 3 years old and only 6 ounces a day for children ages 4 to 6 years old.
  

      “There’s really no health reason to have juice instead of whole fruits and vegetables unless your child cannot tolerate eating regular food,” said Hannon, director of the pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children and professor of medical and molecular genetics at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis.
  






One hundred percent fruit or vegetable juice should not be consumed as a daily serving for nutritional health, said Dr. David Katz, founder of True Health Initiative. Prioritize whole fruits instead.

      Teens and adults should drink no more than 8 ounces a day of 100% juice, according to national nutritional guidelines, and juice should not be seen as a healthy way to quench thirst.
  

      “General guidance is against ‘routine’ intake — in other words, relying on juice rather than water for thirst, or consuming juice specifically for health benefits,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study.
  

      “It’s not for daily health — it’s an occasional sweet treat. In such a context, fruit juice is a much better choice than soda, for many reasons,” said Katz in an email.
  

    How juice impacts the body


      For some, the concern over 100% fruit juice may be baffling — fruit is healthy, right? So, what’s the difference between the fruit and its juice?
  

      “Whole fruits and vegetables come in packages of nutrients — carbohydrates, protein, fat, minerals and vitamins that are all contained with fiber. That’s how our bodies are meant to get nutrition,” Hannon said. “When we take away the package, we take away the fiber and the structural parts of the food, and our body digests and metabolizes it differently than it evolved to do so.”
  

      Eating a whole apple, for example, doesn’t spike blood sugar levels because fructose, the sugar found naturally in fruits and some vegetables, is released slowly into the blood. Drinking apple juice, however, floods the blood with fructose.

      “The blood cannot be sugary. It’s dangerous for organs, so the body has lots of mechanisms to get rid of sugar quickly and keep our blood sugar normal,” Hannon explained. “So, the liver, which metabolizes sugars, converts a large part of those calories into a fat that can be stored easily and kept out of the blood.”
  

      That’s not the only impact, said corresponding study author Vasanti Malik, a research scientist in the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
  

      “When you consume calories in solid form, your brain is better at registering those calories and adjusting your food intake accordingly,” Malik said. “But if you drink those calories, you may not feel full and begin to eat again.”
  

    Portion sizes matter


      The meta-analysis, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed 42 studies: 17 in children and 25 among adults.
  

      “The good thing about a meta-analysis is that it takes small studies and puts all the data together so it can be analyzed as if it were one big study,” Hannon said.
  

      In children, each additional serving per day of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.03 higher body mass index, or BMI, change, according to the study.
  

      Initially, the study did not find an impact on adults due to variations in how calories were measured, Malik said. However, when only a subset of 25 studies that did adjust for calories were reviewed, the results showed a small 0.02 change in BMI.
  

      To calculate adult BMI, weight is divided by the square of a person’s height. A child’s healthy weight range is based on a BMI between the 5th and 85th percentile on the CDC growth charts. As the calculation is more complicated, parents and caregivers should never use an adult BMI calculator to determine their child’s weight status, the CDC said.

Foods and drinks packaged for kids are higher in sugar and lower in nutrition, study shows




      While the changes in BMI found by the study may be tiny per person, “when you look at a small amount over the entire population of the world that’s hugely impactful, especially since most people are not drinking 4 ounces of juice a day, which is a standard serving,” Hannon said.
  

      “They’re drinking 16, 20, 24 ounces of juice a day, which is then associated with significant increases in BMI,” she said. “My advice to parents is always discuss with your doctor, but don’t consider juice to be a healthy drink for when you’re thirsty.
  

      “For snacks and treats offer your child whole fruit if your child can eat it,” Hannon added. “And if you’re using juice as a fruit serving, it should be a half of a cup, no more a day.”"

      Belgian police have found stolen Picasso and Chagall paintings in a basement in the city of Antwerp, local authorities said on Tuesday, adding that the artworks are still in good condition.
  

      The paintings, Picasso’s “Tête” and Chagall’s “L’homme en prière”, were stolen from an art collector in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2010 and are worth $900,000.

      At the time of the theft, $680,000 worth of jewelry was also stolen but only the paintings have been found.
  

      Local police had started an investigation when a source informed them that a Belgian national was offering both artworks for sale.
  

      The local prosecutor said the main suspect has been arrested.

      Belgian police have found stolen Picasso and Chagall paintings in a basement in the city of Antwerp, local authorities said on Tuesday, adding that the artworks are still in good condition.
  

      The paintings, Picasso’s “Tête” and Chagall’s “L’homme en prière”, were stolen from an art collector in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2010 and are worth $900,000.

      At the time of the theft, $680,000 worth of jewelry was also stolen but only the paintings have been found.
  

      Local police had started an investigation when a source informed them that a Belgian national was offering both artworks for sale.
  

      The local prosecutor said the main suspect has been arrested.

         — 
    


      Fans of Spanish football will be accustomed to seeing Real Madrid and a certain Catalan club battle it out at the top of La Liga – only this season that team from northeastern Spain isn’t Barcelona.
  

      It is Girona, playing in only its fourth top-flight season in La Liga, that has improbably become Real’s closest title challenger midway through January, repeatedly upsetting the odds to surge up the standings and sit top of the table, one point ahead of Los Blancos – though Madrid has a game in hand.
  

      Founded in 1930, Girona plays its football at the modest 14,000-capacity Estadi Montilivi on the outskirts of a city that has a population of just 100,000.
  

      For the majority of its history, Girona has competed in the third tier of Spanish football and below, only returning to the second division in 2008 after a 49-year absence.
  

      Girona was previously promoted to La Liga in 2017, spending only two seasons in Spain’s top flight before being relegated. This time, however, the team looks like it is here to stay.
  

      The Blanquivermells’ early success this season has naturally prompted comparisons to Leicester City’s remarkable Premier League-winning season and Spanish football expert Semra Hunter believes those comparisons are merited.
  

      With Real and Girona seven and eight points respectively up on third-placed Barça at the head of the chasing pack, this season is already looking likely to be a two-horse race.

      “I tell you what, why not?” Hunter said when asked if Girona can win the league. “Because they’ve beaten Atlético Madrid, who are one of the favorites for the title this season. They beat Barcelona, who are the reigning champions, another title contender.
  

      “They only lost to Real Madrid. They drew with Real Sociedad, who are another contender to finish top four. I mean, they are taking down the big teams and they’re doing so in quite some style, so I think, at this stage, I think we can dare to dream. Why not?
  

      “Let’s get carried away with this fairy-tale story. It’s a beautiful story. History is being made and, at the very least, I think they’re going to be in the Champions League next season. Any team at this stage that has had this amount of points has always qualified for the Champions League. So I would say that’s a pretty big win no matter what.”
  

      Girona also boasts the additional benefit of not having to play European football, which could turn Real’s focus away from the league once the Champions League knockout stage begins in February, while Ancelotti’s side also had to deal with the rigors of flying to Saudi Arabia to play two Spanish Super Cup matches.
  

    Míchel, ma belle


      There are a multitude of factors that have contributed to Girona’s rise, but perhaps principle among them is the manager leading the team: Miguel Ángel Sánchez Muñoz, better known as Míchel.


      A Madrid boy born and raised, Míchel is an icon at boyhood club Rayo Vallecano after spending the majority of his playing career there across two spells.

      After managing Rayo and then Huesca, Míchel took the reins at Girona in 2021 when the club was back in Spain’s competitive second division. He got the club promoted at the first time of asking and then consolidated with an impressive 10th-place finish last season.
  

      Girona CEO Ignasi Mas-Bagà says Míchel deserves “a lot of credit” for the team’s recent success.
  

      “It’s his third season with us now and I think the players now really understand what he wants, the style of play,” Mas-Bagà told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell.
  

      “He wants to keep the ball, a lot of possession and to score goals – and we’re the team that’s scored the most goals in the league.
  

      “Positively, we can say that the job during the week [in training] is translated on the pitch with results.”
  

      But while Girona’s progress has been clear for all to see, nobody would have expected the huge leap the team has taken this season – and Míchel has been doing it in style.
  

      So entertaining is his brand of football, that Hunter says it feels like “every single match for Girona is the match of the season,” typified by the team’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Atlético Madrid on January 3.

      “He’s really taken to the Catalan lifestyle like a duck to water,” she explains. “He learned Catalan very quickly. He’s won over the fans, he’s won over the board. He’s young, he’s intelligent, he’s ambitious, he’s driven. He’s incredibly good with his players.
  

      “He pays a lot of attention to detail as well. The fine tuning of what needs to happen during a game or in the lead up to the game. He has a brilliant group of players that are very much a collective. There is no superstar in the side – they very much are a strong team as a unit.
  

      “I think part of it has to do with the fact that the board have been so incredibly intelligent in listening to their manager and listening to what was needed and saying: ‘Right, let’s be really smart about how we go into the market in the summer, how we build a team. What specifically are the profiles of the players that we need?’”

      In 2017, the City Football Group (CFG), which owns Manchester City, purchased a majority stake in Girona, which is now one of 13 clubs under the CFG umbrella.
  

      However, as Hunter explains, being owned by one of the wealthiest clubs in the world doesn’t automatically provide Girona with a bottomless pit of money and the club has continued to be “very resourceful” and “very smart” when scouting and signing players on a “small” budget.

      Of the current squad, only impressive young defender Yan Couto is on loan from parent club City, though Yangel Herrera, Aleix García and Eric García have also previously been on the books.
  

      While much of Girona’s success stems from the team being more than the sum of its parts, Ukrainian forward Artem Dovbyk, who arrived from SC Dnipro-1 in the summer, has emerged as a potent goal threat with 11 goals in 18 league appearances.
  

      Additionally, Mas-Bagà says Míchel can often pick the brain of City manager Pep Guardiola when the pair “speak from time to time” about football.
  

      “They have a lot of similarities,” he says. “They speak the same language of football and I know they speak after some games and they get on very well.
  

      “I think this is also very positive [for Girona] and I think Pep is an inspiration for Míchel.”
  

      Despite Girona’s historic start to the campaign, Hunter says the team will be wary of a Real Madrid side that has continued to churn out wins behind La Liga’s most stingy defense, despite not playing well for large parts of the season.
  

      But as Ancelotti begins welcoming players back from injury, it is inevitable that a team whose “DNA is all about winning” will be in the hunt come the end of the season, particularly off the back of Real’s impressive goalscoring performances – netting nine goals against rivals Atlético and Barça – as it went on to lift the Spanish Super Cup.

      Regardless, Girona has earned the right to dream and Hunter says upsetting the odds and winning La Liga “would mean everything” to the club and its fans.
  

      “It’s the ultimate underdog story,” she says. “It’s David versus Goliath and seeing an outlier like a Girona, which historically is a basketball city and has only been in the top flight ever four times, it would be absolutely monumental.”"

         — 
    


      UK inflation accelerated in December for the first time since February last year, official data showed Wednesday.
  

      Consumer prices rose 4% last month compared with a year ago, up from a rate of 3.9% in November, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slowdown to 3.8%
  

      Rises in tobacco prices due to recent duty increases were partially offset by falling food inflation, “where prices still rose but at a much lower rate than this time last year,” ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said in a statement.
  

      “The prices of goods leaving factories are little changed over the last few months, while the costs of raw materials remain lower than a year ago,” he added.
  

      Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, remained stuck at 5.1%, while services inflation increased from 6.3% to 6.4%.
  

      The UK data mirrors the trend in the United States and Europe of slight upticks in headline inflation. The increases have led many economists to argue that the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which target a headline inflation rate of 2%, are unlikely to cut interest rates as soon as markets anticipate.
  

      Other economists counter that inflation is still losing momentum overall.
  

      Risks to that outlook include recent attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, which are disrupting supply chains and could drive up the prices of manufactured goods. Energy prices could also rise if the conflict in the Middle East escalates further.
  

      Still, several leading UK economists shrugged off the latest increase in inflation, noting that inflation could return to the Bank of England’s 2% target by the spring, helped by recent falls in energy prices.
  

      “Inflation in the economy is still broadly moving in the right direction,” said Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors.
  

      Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, added: “The expected overall improvement in the outlook for inflation, coupled with the slowdown in the domestic economy, will likely put the Bank of England in a position to begin cutting interest rates from the second half of the year, potentially lowering rates by (1 percentage point) in 2024.”"

CNN
         — 
    


      Elon Musk says he wants a significantly larger stake in Tesla than the one that already made him the richest person on the planet.
  

      In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.
  

      “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”
  

      Notably, Musk held a stake of more than 20% in Tesla before he sold a large number of shares to buy X, the social media company he purchased over a year ago for $44 billion.
  

      Tesla remains the leader in electric vehicles, but the competition is gaining ground. Musk has said the company’s future lies in AI and robotics. In January 2022, he said on a call with Wall Street analysts that he believes the company’s goal of building a humanoid robot is the most important technology it’s developing. Musk said of its planned robot, “This I think has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.”
  

      The robot is notably not ready for prime time: Introduced at the company’s AI Day in September, the robot, dubbed Optimus by Tesla, walked stiffly on stage, slowly waved at the crowed and gestured with its hands for roughly one minute. Nevertheless, Tesla believes in a robot-led future, and investors have sent the stock surging over the past year in the hopes that Musk & Co. can deliver innovations that propel the company to new heights.
  

      So any signal that Musk won’t continue that line of work at Tesla could be unnerving for investors. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Tuesday.
  

    Massive pay package


      Musk has gone several years without a new compensation plan. Worth $56 billion when it was announced in 2018, his previous plan was the biggest pay package for any CEO in history. The deal was so large that Musk and Tesla faced a shareholder lawsuit over the package last year, and they continue to await a Delaware Chancery Court ruling on whether the pay was excessive.
  

      The lead plaintiff in that lawsuit claimed Musk exploited his control over the company and its board of directors to get the massive pay package and said Musk had incentive enough before he got the enormous addition of shares because he already had enough ownership of the company. Musk and the Tesla board of directors were accused of breaching their fiduciary duties for waste and unjust enrichment.

Fidelity fund again trims Elon Musk’s X valuation




      Musk on Monday said he and Tesla are waiting for ruling in the case before they agree to a new pay package.
  

      “I should note that the Tesla board is great,” Musk said in an X post. “The reason for no new ‘compensation plan’ is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case.”
  

      Musk then said he put “compensation plan” in quotes because he is mainly concerned about the amount of ownership he holds. The Tesla CEO argued that he wields too little influence at the company and fears that asset managers that hold massive stakes in Tesla, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, could undermine his ability to transform the company if he sought to take it in a new direction.
  

      “If I have 25%, it means I am influential, but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me,” Musk wrote. “At 15% or lower, the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy.”
  

      Many tech companies have a dual-class voting system, in which a founder or early leader like Musk has multiple votes for each share to maintain their outsized influence of the company. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, holds 61% of the voting power at Meta despite Vanguard, BlackRock and Fidelity owning more Meta stock than he does.
  

      But Musk said a dual-class system at Tesla was a nonstarter, blaming a “post-IPO Delaware.” It’s unclear exactly what Musk meant by that. Regulators have been pushing back on those kind of ownership structures, but they’re still allowed."

      Many tech companies have a dual-class voting system, in which a founder or early leader like Musk has multiple votes for each share to maintain their outsized influence of the company. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, holds 61% of the voting power at Meta despite Vanguard, BlackRock and Fidelity owning more Meta stock than he does.
  

      But Musk said a dual-class system at Tesla was a nonstarter, blaming a “post-IPO Delaware.” It’s unclear exactly what Musk meant by that. Regulators have been pushing back on those kind of ownership structures, but they’re still allowed."

      There is a dangerous undercurrent dragging Americans who wade into the political waters out toward the extreme. But much of the national press, basking ashore on the sun-soaked beach, refuses to acknowledge it in a serious manner.
  

      Instead, many journalists have grown comfortable glossing over the treacherous rip tide lurking beneath the surface of the water before their very eyes. They report that scores of swimmers have been dragged into the menacing waters of the deep sea, but never do they acknowledge the conditions that led them there.
  

      It’s as if identifying the cause of the calamity is too much to ask. It is, apparently, a bridge too far. The invisible, yet threatening, forces must remain invisible.
  

      That’s how reading and watching much of the coverage of the Iowa caucuses came across. Yes, the national political press pointed to an alarming entrance poll showing that an overwhelming majority — 66% — of GOP caucusgoers do not accept Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And yes, the news media accurately noted that Donald Trump maintains a firm grip over the Republican Party, despite inciting an insurrection and being ensnared in a messy web of legal battles, among other things.
  

      But crucial coverage of the grave undercurrent in GOP politics that propelled the caucusgoers far outside the Overton window — believing that the duly elected president is not actually the duly-elected president, despite countless fact-checks and court rulings — received little-to-no attention. While one might expect the poll to set off alarm bells and deep soul-searching about the fate of the nation’s democracy, the press failed to interrogate the issue in a real way.
  

      Embarrassingly, Ron DeSantis has done more in recent days than most in the press to call attention to the matter. The Florida governor accurately noted last week that Republican voters operate in a dishonest information environment in which Trump receives little criticism but plenty of praise.
  

      Of course, the observation from DeSantis, himself a culture warrior who has refrained from assailing Trump in a meaningful way while contributing generously to public distrust of the press, is rich. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t right on the mark.
  

      On a daily basis, cable channels such as Fox News, a stable of national and local talk-radio hosts, an assortment of online influencers, and a network of online outlets such as Breitbart dump reams of toxic waste into the national discourse. That is not without consequence.
  

      The propaganda machine supporting Trump has deceived the GOP, twisting the party into believing outright lies that have been publicly rebuked by the former president’s one-time confidantes. But, instead of identifying the crux of the matter and vigorously calling it out, most major newsrooms demur when presented with repeated evidence of its corrosive and widespread effects.
  

      It goes without saying that there are many reasons for this reality. For one, it is still perhaps uncomfortable to acknowledge the depths of dishonesty in which much of right-wing media now operates. More importantly, however, most news organizations are terrified of being perceived as biased — and delivering such a fact set to viewers could contribute to distrust among Republicans (though it’s likely they already do distrust the press).
  

      Whatever the reason, it should not translate into coverage of paramount importance failing to be transmitted to audiences. The news media’s duty is to deliver the plain facts, regardless of fear or favor or anything else standing in its way. Choosing to back down and ignore the hazardous conditions offshore amounts to a dereliction of duty.
  

      Unfortunately, that is precisely what so much of the press continues to do. The country is at risk of drowning — and the press watches from the shore, unwilling to sound the alarm about the insidious forces plunging Americans into the stormy seas."

      Investors are eagerly anticipating Wednesday’s US retail sales report.
  

      That’s because the strength of the US economy rests on the shoulders of consumers, making this among the most important gauges we have. If people are spending money, companies keep employees in their jobs and the cycle goes on.
  

      Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of America’s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, so a recession is nearly impossible as long as consumer spending is growing.
  

      And so far, American shoppers have continued to shell out cash for purchases, despite stubbornly high (though waning) inflation and interest rates at 23-year highs.
  

      Wednesday’s report is expected to be a good one — economists polled by FactSet expect that a strong holiday shopping season boosted consumer spending by 0.4% in December from the month prior. That’s on top of a 0.3% increase in November.
  

      But new data from the New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday has soured the mood on Wall Street.
  

      The report showed that Americans have slowed some of their spending and that they expect to pull back a little more. The median increase in monthly household spending slowed to 5.01% on an annual basis in December 2023, down from 5.5% in August 2023 and 7.1% in December 2022, according to the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations Household Spending data.
  

      That’s the lowest reading since April 2021, according to my colleague Alicia Wallace.
  

      The outlook for consumer spending doesn’t look so bright, either. The median expected growth in monthly spending dropped to 3%, the lowest since December 2020.
  

      Survey respondents also said they expected to reduce their spending on essentials like groceries.
  

A confluence of problems: But just as the retail sector was beginning to normalize — having successfully survived Covid-induced supply chain kinks, shutdowns, persistently elevated inflation and unusually high interest rates — it appears that global instability could once again wreak havoc on shipping and throw the sector for a loop.
  

      Container vessels are now avoiding both the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, as Iranian-backed Houthi fighters attack ships in what they say is retaliation for Israel’s war against Hamas. The Suez is the main route for shipments from Asia to Europe and to the east coast of the US, and rerouting is causing delays and driving up transportation costs.
  

The World Container Index, a composite index of container freight rates on eight major routes to and from the United States, Europe, and Asia, increased by 15% last week, according to Drewry, a maritime research and consulting firm. It’s doubled since early December.
  

      Those increased shipping costs could get passed on to the consumer, just as inflation rates have started to fall and the Federal Reserve appears ready to lower interest rates.
  

Yes, but: Still, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan believes the consumer will remain resilient.
  

      “We have people who are making money, who are employed. Unemployment is very low, they are getting paid more,” he told CNN’s Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week.
  

      “Inflation is still tough on a lot of them, so you can’t discount that, but on the other hand the stock market being up, they’ve got accumulated wealth, they are making a lot more money,” he said.
  

    Bob Iger made $31.6 million as Disney’s CEO last year


      Disney CEO Bob Iger raked in $31.6 million in compensation last year — a multimillion-dollar boost from his income the year before, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya.
  

      Iger’s 2023 pay package included a base salary of $865,385, stock awards totaling $16.1 million, $10 million in stock option awards, $2.1 million in performance-based compensation and $2.48 million in other compensation, according to The Walt Disney Company’s annual proxy statement, which was filed Tuesday.
  

      Despite Iger’s multimillion-dollar paycheck, Disney has faced growing challenges in the past year, including a string of box office flops, declining linear TV viewership and an uneven transition into a streaming future.
  

      In November, Disney said it would slash its expenses by another $2 billion, adding to the $5.5 billion reduction it had previously announced as it looks to rebuild its business in a rapidly changing media environment.
  

    China’s population declines for second straight year as economy stumbles


      China reported a record low birth rate in 2023 as its population shrank for the second year in a row.
  

      The trend marked the deepening of a demographic challenge set to have significant implications on the world’s second largest economy, report my colleagues Laura He and Simone McCarthy.
  

      The country recorded 6.39 births per 1,000 people, down from 6.77 a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Wednesday. The birth rate is the lowest since the founding of Communist China in 1949.
  

      The country’s demographic shift comes at a time when its growth is sputtering. The NBS confirmed that China’s economy grew by 5.2% last year, compared to a government target of around 5%.
  

      While this expansion marks a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s worst economic performances in over three decades."

      Namibia produced a historic upset to beat Tunisia 1-0 on Tuesday and record its first ever Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) victory.
  

      Appearing in its fourth AFCON, Namibia had failed to win any of its previous nine finals matches, losing seven and drawing two.

      However, the southern African nation, ranked 115th in the world and 87 places below Tunisia, was a deserving winner as midfielder Deon Hotto made himself the hero with an 88th-minute winner.
  

      Hotto’s header sparked wild scenes on the Namibia bench and in the stands, as 33-year-old leapt over the advertising hoardings to celebrate his goal in front of an ecstatic group of fans.
  

      It continues a string of surprise results at the tournament, hosted in the Ivory Coast, with Ghana losing 2-1 in stoppage time to Cape Verde on Sunday.
  

      Elsewhere, Egypt needed a last-gasp Mo Salah penalty to salvage a draw against Mozambique, while Algeria, Cameroon and Nigeria were held to draws in matches they were heavily favored to win.
  

      Tunisia, the 2004 AFCON champion, is the No. 1 seed in Group E but now faces a tricky path to reach the knockout stages, with Mali and South Africa still to play.

         — 
    


      Balanced on the side of one hull, New Zealand’s black catamaran glides over the finish line at the deep-water Zayed Port, its 29-meter-long carbon fiber wing stiff in the sea breeze.
  

      Just meters away, a grandstand with thousands of spectators erupts in excited cheers, as the Kiwis take their second win in the Persian Gulf in a matter of weeks.
  

      When you think of race weekends in Abu Dhabi, Formula One comes to mind. But now there is a new sport in the United Arab Emirates’ capital – SailGP.
  

      The Mubadala Abu Dhabi Sail Grand Prix is new to the global 13-race calendar. Presented by the Abu Dhabi Sports Council, it’s advertised as two days of winner-takes-all adrenaline-fueled racing, with crews aiming to pick up points to add to those accumulated already at races in cities such as San Francisco and Sydney.
  

      “It’s all about really making it a better race, and a better entertainment spectacle,” SailGP’s chief Russell Coutts recently told CNN’s Becky Anderson, ahead of the race in Abu Dhabi.
  

Coutts is one of the biggest names in sailing and before becoming the brainchild of SailGP, he was a five-time America’s Cup winner and multiple world champion, also winning a gold medal for New Zealand at the 1984 Olympics.
  

      He’s hoping the enormous F50 catamarans will be a big draw for new fans. They can reach speeds of nearly 100 km/h (62m/h), sending 300,000 data points every second through 5G routers so that teams can analyze their movements in real time.
  

      The quays at Zayed Port were occupied by two large cranes tasked with winching the boats onto the water. During races, sailors appear ant-sized to spectators, crawling over the hulls or being pinned down to the craft by the G-force.
  

      “This is really a whole new dimension,” Coutts said. “And the moment that the boats got out of the water and on foils, and started to go so fast, I think that really spiked the interest of a much wider group of people.”

      But they don’t come cheap, costing around $5 million to build, with extra costs in the millions to manage teams and logistics on top of that. A record 1.78 million viewers in the United States tuned into the Spain leg of the championship, but for the sport to survive, expanding and bringing in even newer audiences is vital.
  

      “Well, our audience, if you compare season two to season three, our broadcast audience grew three times through our dedicated viewership,” said Coutts. “So the team’s values are growing enormously as well. The latest team sold for $35 million.”
  

      It’s not just about making the races fast and furious. Coutts is also bringing in other forms of entertainment – English pop group Take That was the star headliner in Abu Dhabi.
  

      “It’s been elitist, and we wanted to break down all of those barriers, and really bring it closer to the people, and provide more entertainment around our racing,” Coutts added.
  

      “So, our racing’s a short format packaged into a 90-minute broadcast window.”

    Sailing to sustainability


      The F50 catamarans don’t just float; they fly.
  

      “Foiling is actually combining a bit like flying to the sailing sport,” explained Nicole van der Velden, a member of the Spanish crew, while giving CNN a tour of the team’s hangar.
  

      “So it’s the same concept as an airplane, as an airplane wing. The water, when it moves through the foil, it creates a difference in speed, going above and below the same as an airplane wing.”

      The sailing weight of the catamarans is 2.4 tons, and the wings can stretch to 29 meters. Moving them from site to site is a huge operation, while marine life can also be disturbed when setting up the races.
  

      The series’ carbon footprint last year, including travelling fans, was the equivalent of 79,786 tonnes of carbon dioxide; for context, Formula One emitted roughly 256,000 tonnes in 2019.
  

      The majority of SailGP’s footprint is not entirely in its control, being made up of supply chain logistics and fan travel, posing a challenge to Coutts.
  

      “Out remote television production, or our remote umpiring, or our remote race management … It means that less people have to travel to these events,” he said.
  

      “It’s more cost effective, it creates a better solution for the environment and a better product for the fan.”
  

      Coutts has also set up an Impact League, where teams a awarded points based on sustainability and inclusivity efforts.
  

      “So basically, it’s helping youngsters evolving in the sports, to having a cleaner environment, having a smaller carbon footprint, using solar energy, wind energy to power up everything that we need as well. So yeah, the league is trying to really take a step further in that,” said Van der Velden.

    Abu Dhabi’s maritime heritage


      The UAEs’ culture is rich in maritime heritage – pearl diving was once the driving force of the economy, and fishing is a firmly embedded tradition.
  

      Now, silhouetted by the city’s skyline, fans pack glittering grandstands, just meters away from modern racing boats, making the event a clear draw for Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund; a new partner in the global sailing series.
  

      “25% of our portfolio sits in Abu Dhabi. This is a geography that is important for us,” Homaid Al Shimmari, deputy CEO of Mubadala, told CNN.
  

      “It brings back a bit of the culture that we had … Heritage is there, but then you bring SailGP with all of these technologies.”
  

      Bringing another high-profile sporting event to Abu Dhabi is not the only ambition for Mubadala.
  

      “This is not about the race and about the teams and about the championship,” said Al Shimarri. “It’s about how can we get the younger generation to be interested in sailing and how to make it more inclusive?”
  

      SailGP’s Inspire program, which aims to bring young participants into the sport without any barrier to entry, has already engaged nearly 16,000 people. Mubadala has also partnered with SailGP to help promote STEM education and sport within Inspire.
  

      “We have almost 1,200 kids sitting in Abu Dhabi Sports Club for a whole week being excited about this,” said Al Shimarri.
  

      “We have students from NYU, New York, four of them to come and spend the whole week working with the SailGP … to entice the next generations who are interested in science, STEM, latest technologies, and then bring it to this wonderful, comfortable city that we love.”
  






SailGP hopes to increase the interest of sailing as a spectator sport.

      The sport can be dominated by men, and SailGP is no different, with no female drivers on their boats. In its inaugural year, there were no women involved, but this changed after the inclusion of a requirement for teams to have at least one female member aboard.
  

      It’s part of SailGP’s commitment to promote inclusivity through its Women’s Pathway program.
  

      “Our objective, and I hope we’re going to see this by season six, maybe even season five, is to not only have a woman driver racing in this league, but hopefully a woman driver that’s capable of winning this league,” said Coutts, when asked about the issues around inclusivity.
  

      Van der Velden is the only female member of the Spanish crew and works as a strategist, which involves her supplying information that the rest of the crew uses to make best use of the weather conditions and route. All the female SailGP athletes on six-person crews occupy this role, but some hope to one day be the drivers.
  

      The sailors were tested by challenging light winds in Abu Dhabi, where Van der Velden and Spain finished runners-up behind the dominant New Zealand team. The Kiwis are closing the gap on three-time champions Australia at the top of the leaderboard, with a United States team led by seven-time world champion, Taylor Canfield, in third.
  

      For Coutts and those working on land, it’s all hands-on deck to pursue the bigger picture. The burgeoning new sport is attempting to make waves but must still attract the large audiences it needs to thrive, while lowering its carbon footprint to meet its lofty goals."

         — 
    


      Balanced on the side of one hull, New Zealand’s black catamaran glides over the finish line at the deep-water Zayed Port, its 29-meter-long carbon fiber wing stiff in the sea breeze.
  

      Just meters away, a grandstand with thousands of spectators erupts in excited cheers, as the Kiwis take their second win in the Persian Gulf in a matter of weeks.
  

      When you think of race weekends in Abu Dhabi, Formula One comes to mind. But now there is a new sport in the United Arab Emirates’ capital – SailGP.
  

      The Mubadala Abu Dhabi Sail Grand Prix is new to the global 13-race calendar. Presented by the Abu Dhabi Sports Council, it’s advertised as two days of winner-takes-all adrenaline-fueled racing, with crews aiming to pick up points to add to those accumulated already at races in cities such as San Francisco and Sydney.
  

      “It’s all about really making it a better race, and a better entertainment spectacle,” SailGP’s chief Russell Coutts recently told CNN’s Becky Anderson, ahead of the race in Abu Dhabi.
  

Coutts is one of the biggest names in sailing and before becoming the brainchild of SailGP, he was a five-time America’s Cup winner and multiple world champion, also winning a gold medal for New Zealand at the 1984 Olympics.
  

      He’s hoping the enormous F50 catamarans will be a big draw for new fans. They can reach speeds of nearly 100 km/h (62m/h), sending 300,000 data points every second through 5G routers so that teams can analyze their movements in real time.
  

      The quays at Zayed Port were occupied by two large cranes tasked with winching the boats onto the water. During races, sailors appear ant-sized to spectators, crawling over the hulls or being pinned down to the craft by the G-force.
  

      “This is really a whole new dimension,” Coutts said. “And the moment that the boats got out of the water and on foils, and started to go so fast, I think that really spiked the interest of a much wider group of people.”

      But they don’t come cheap, costing around $5 million to build, with extra costs in the millions to manage teams and logistics on top of that. A record 1.78 million viewers in the United States tuned into the Spain leg of the championship, but for the sport to survive, expanding and bringing in even newer audiences is vital.
  

      “Well, our audience, if you compare season two to season three, our broadcast audience grew three times through our dedicated viewership,” said Coutts. “So the team’s values are growing enormously as well. The latest team sold for $35 million.”
  

      It’s not just about making the races fast and furious. Coutts is also bringing in other forms of entertainment – English pop group Take That was the star headliner in Abu Dhabi.
  

      “It’s been elitist, and we wanted to break down all of those barriers, and really bring it closer to the people, and provide more entertainment around our racing,” Coutts added.
  

      “So, our racing’s a short format packaged into a 90-minute broadcast window.”

    Sailing to sustainability


      The F50 catamarans don’t just float; they fly.
  

      “Foiling is actually combining a bit like flying to the sailing sport,” explained Nicole van der Velden, a member of the Spanish crew, while giving CNN a tour of the team’s hangar.
  

      “So it’s the same concept as an airplane, as an airplane wing. The water, when it moves through the foil, it creates a difference in speed, going above and below the same as an airplane wing.”

      The sailing weight of the catamarans is 2.4 tons, and the wings can stretch to 29 meters. Moving them from site to site is a huge operation, while marine life can also be disturbed when setting up the races.
  

      The series’ carbon footprint last year, including travelling fans, was the equivalent of 79,786 tonnes of carbon dioxide; for context, Formula One emitted roughly 256,000 tonnes in 2019.
  

      The majority of SailGP’s footprint is not entirely in its control, being made up of supply chain logistics and fan travel, posing a challenge to Coutts.
  

      “Out remote television production, or our remote umpiring, or our remote race management … It means that less people have to travel to these events,” he said.
  

      “It’s more cost effective, it creates a better solution for the environment and a better product for the fan.”
  

      Coutts has also set up an Impact League, where teams a awarded points based on sustainability and inclusivity efforts.
  

      “So basically, it’s helping youngsters evolving in the sports, to having a cleaner environment, having a smaller carbon footprint, using solar energy, wind energy to power up everything that we need as well. So yeah, the league is trying to really take a step further in that,” said Van der Velden.

    Abu Dhabi’s maritime heritage


      The UAEs’ culture is rich in maritime heritage – pearl diving was once the driving force of the economy, and fishing is a firmly embedded tradition.
  

      Now, silhouetted by the city’s skyline, fans pack glittering grandstands, just meters away from modern racing boats, making the event a clear draw for Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund; a new partner in the global sailing series.
  

      “25% of our portfolio sits in Abu Dhabi. This is a geography that is important for us,” Homaid Al Shimmari, deputy CEO of Mubadala, told CNN.
  

      “It brings back a bit of the culture that we had … Heritage is there, but then you bring SailGP with all of these technologies.”
  

      Bringing another high-profile sporting event to Abu Dhabi is not the only ambition for Mubadala.
  

      “This is not about the race and about the teams and about the championship,” said Al Shimarri. “It’s about how can we get the younger generation to be interested in sailing and how to make it more inclusive?”

         — 
    


      The lineup for Southern California’s legendary, desert-centric Coachella music festival has officially been announced, and there’s no doubt it’ll be a good time.
  

      On Tuesday, Goldenvoice, the company that produces the long-running festival, revealed that the 2024 lineup features popular ska/punk/rock band No Doubt as one of the four headlining acts.
  

      The band’s appearance will mark a reunion between the members, which include frontwoman Gwen Stefani. No Doubt has not performed live as a band since at least 2015.
  

      Lana Del Rey, Doja Cat and rapper Tyler, The Creator are also set to headline the festival, with other notable artists such as Peso Pluma, Ice Spice, Blur, Sublime and J. Balvin slated to take one of the festival’s many stages.
  

      Just before the official lineup announcement was made on Tuesday, the No Doubt X page teased a reunion when it posted a video of Stefani reminiscing about her early days with the band.
  

      The video culminated in Stefani setting up a video call with her No Doubt bandmates  – Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, and Adrian Young – after noting how much she missed them.
  

      “You guys want to do a show?” Stefani asked, to which Kanal, Dumont and Young all replied with an enthusiastic “yes!”
  

      While No Doubt did not announce any additional concert dates, their upcoming Coachella gig marks nearly 10 years since the band has toured together. No Doubt originally formed in the mid-90s and became known for their classic hits “Don’t Speak,” “Just a Girl” and “Spiderwebs,” among many others.
  

      In the early aughts, the band went on to pursue solo projects after releasing a number of albums together. In 2004, Stefani released her first solo album “Love. Angel. Music. Baby.” and has released three more solo albums since then.
  

      Last year’s Coachella headliners included Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, Korean pop group Blackpink and singer Frank Ocean. Due to an injury, Ocean pulled out of performing the festival’s second weekend, with band Blink-182 filling in.
  

      The live music festival will return to Indio’s Empire Polo Field for two consecutive weekends on April 12-14 and April 19-21 this year."

https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/health/weight-drugs-chasing-life-wellness/index.html,Dr. Sanjay Gupta: What weight tells us about our health,"(CNN) — If you’ve been paying attention to health news recently, you may have noticed a subtle but real shift in the way society discusses body weight. It started about 10 years ago with the body positivity movement, the idea that we should love our bodies at any size. But around that time, the American Medical Association also classified obesity as a disease. The medical community was divided, with some believing the classification would help reduce stigma while others argued that it pathologized larger bodies.
  

      These transformational changes picked up speed with the arrival of powerful and wildly popular new medications that have already helped many people shed pounds.
  

      We on the “Chasing Life” podcast team think it’s the perfect time to try to sort through some of these medical and cultural threads. That’s why we’re turning the spotlight on body weight in the coming season. For those listeners who, like me, really love the brain, there will be plenty here for you too, as the brain and body are forever linked.
  

      We’re not going to reveal the secret to losing weight “with one weird trick” or even tell you that you should necessarily shed pounds. In fact, our very first episode explores the real link between weight and health. I spoke to Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, about what our weight does and does not tell us about our health — and what she said might surprise you.
  




    Beyond health care dollars


      Despite changing attitudes about larger bodies, excess weight does carry a price.
  

      From a health care standpoint, it costs the country a lot of money. According to a study published in the journal The Lancet in 2020, 27% of total health care expenditures in 2016 — about $730.4 billion — could be attributed to “modifiable risk factors” for preventable health conditions like cardiovascular disease. And high body mass index topped the list of those risk factors. It was responsible for nearly a third of that sum: $238.5 billion.

Nearly 1 in 10 teens worldwide have used ineffective and potentially harmful weight-loss products, study estimates




      That was eight years ago, when our total health care expenditure was $2.7 trillion, according to the study. But health expenditures have only gotten larger: They grew by more than a trillion dollars between 2016 and 2022, when they hit $4.5 trillion, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts. Without throwing even more numbers at you, I think we can safely say we are paying a lot of money for health care ultimately caused by excess weight.
  

      But beyond the health care costs to society, there are real costs for individuals in terms of well-being, both physical and mental – and you can’t really put a price tag on that.
  

Almost 3 in 4 Americans 20 and older are classified as overweight or obese. But weight stigma is widespread, and our culture is steeped in blame and shame when it comes to weight.
  

      It creates relentless pressure on hundreds of millions of people to slim down, exercise more and conform to certain beauty standards that are hard for many to approximate, let alone achieve on an enduring basis. They’re admonished to “get healthy,” which is often code for “lose weight.”
  

      All the blood, sweat and tears do not even take into account the fact that the system we use to categorize people, body mass index, is flawed in the first place.
  

      When Belgian mathematician, statistician and astronomer Adolphe Quetelet developed the formula (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared equals BMI) in the 1830s, he was trying to figure out, statistically speaking, the size of an “average man.” And by that I mean average European male in the 1830s.

Insurance denials for popular new weight loss medications leave patients with risky choices




      The Quetelet formula was rebranded in 1972 as “body mass index” by physiologist Dr. Ancel Keys, who tried — and not without some controversy — to link body composition to health, disease and survival.
  

      The formula, as Quetelet imagined it, was never meant to be used as a diagnosis. It was never meant to be applicable to other global populations. It does not take into account factors such as general health, muscle vs. bone vs. fat, gender, age subcutaneous vs. visceral fat or other considerations. And the categories (“underweight,” “normal,” “overweight” and “obese”) have arbitrary cutoffs.
  

      “I can’t just judge the book by its cover and assume that someone [who] is larger is unhealthy and someone who is lean is healthy,” Stanford told me, referring to a person’s size and BMI. “That’s the assumption that people make. I call that practicing street-corner medicine.”
  

      She said she looks beneath the surface of the individual to assess their health – for example, with bloodwork and their functional ability — “because someone who’s lean may be very unhealthy, and someone who’s heavier may be healthier.”
  

    Has the cavalry arrived?


      Stanford’s approach embodies a new way for doctors to think about weight. It parallels the body positivity movement and the body neutrality movement, appreciating your body for what it can do. These cultural shifts have appeared to be nudging us all toward becoming more accepting of larger bodies without having to change them, as long as they are physiologically and functionally healthy.
  

      And then came a twist: the widespread adoption of a powerful and effective new class of medications originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Those drugs include semaglutide (sold as Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound) as well as the older liraglutide (sold as Victoza and Saxenda). It’s hard to overestimate their impact on popular culture – and on the bodies of those who take them.

CNN Exclusive: Older weight loss drugs are making a comeback as Zepbound, Wegovy remain out of reach for many




      As of September, 1.7% of the US population was prescribed semaglutide for either diabetes or weight loss, and that figure is only expected to grow. A projection from JP Morgan analysts says that by 2030, 9% of the country’s population will be on these medications. That’s 30 million Americans. And drugmakers are hard at work synthesizing even more powerful medications.
  

      These medications work by mimicking certain hormones our bodies release when we eat. When these hormones — or the drugs that mimic them – attach to receptors in our bodies, they are believed to do a number of things, including stimulating insulin production and signaling to our brains that we are satiated or full and can stop eating. One of the hormones, GLP-1, has also been shown to slow digestion so we feel fuller for longer.
  

      For anyone who has ever tried to diet, that’s a pretty big deal, especially the parts about feeling full for longer and telling your brain that your body is done eating.
  

      By many accounts, these new medications reduce “food noise” or “brain chatter,” intrusive thoughts about food, your next meal or that peach ice cream in the freezer. For many people, that food noise essentially creates the need for the constant exertion of willpower 24/7, an exhausting battle akin to walking around every day with a backpack full of rocks. (These drugs are so successful at quieting brain chatter that they’re being studied for other compulsive behaviors such as substance abuse, alcohol use disorder, smoking and gambling addiction.)
  

    A coming change in the way we think about obesity


      After covering medical news for more than two decades, I can say the introduction of these medications feels different. As with Prozac in the late 1980s and Viagra in the late 1990s, the arrival of these medications appears to be pivotal, maybe even revolutionary, because they work and seem to be safe, for the most part. That’s not to say some people don’t have unpleasant side effects and even, on occasion, very serious ones. Additionally, I should point out that when the drugs are stopped, the weight often returns, making these likely life-long drugs.

Rebel Wilson says she ‘lost focus’ on her health and regained 30 lbs.




      We are also in the middle of what I might call a paradigm shift in the way we think about the “disease” of obesity.
  

      There’s a new idea, not fully formed with all the data yet, that there are different types of obesity. Soon, these different subtypes may be thought of as distinct diseases, much like how breast cancer is no longer considered one disease but many. These subtypes of obesity don’t all have the same underlying biology or cause, nor do they necessarily respond to the same types of treatment.
  

      And that makes sense: We are not all built the same, and we have to take that into account. I know this from experience. My wife and I each wore a glucose monitor to track our blood sugar for a couple of weeks last year. Even though we both ate the same diet during that time, we found that certain foods caused our blood sugar to spike, and others did not – but it was different for each of us. I was sad to learn that one staple that spiked mine (but not Rebecca’s) is this Indian flatbread my mom makes; it’s a favorite of mine and my dad’s. (I shared this with my father, who has type 2 diabetes. He laughed and told me he already knew, because his glucose monitor had alerted him, as well!)
  

    Success and shame


      Even as we appear to be moving into a new phase of how we think about weight and weight loss in this country, thanks to changing attitudes and new medications, there’s still a fair amount of shame and stigma surrounding weight. They appear in two varieties.
  

      The first form comes if you don’t use these new medications and remain in a larger-than-culturally-accepted body — and to be clear, many people cannot access or afford the medications, others can’t tolerate them, and some don’t lose as much weight as they hoped.

FDA says it’s seized ‘thousands of units’ of counterfeit Ozempic




      The second form of shame comes if you do use them, because few people are willing to talk openly about it. It is rare for a celebrity to be forthright about doing so. It’s akin to admitting that you lack the willpower to do this on your own or that you’re taking the easy way out.
  

      We don’t place the same amount of shame on people who take medications for high cholesterol or high blood pressure. So why do we do this with weight loss medications, especially when most of us know from experience how hard it is to lose weight and keep it off?
  

      (In episode 2 of this season, we’ll investigate the evolutionary forces at work when we speak to Harvard paleoanthropologist Dr. Daniel Lieberman, who’ll explain why our bodies are built to hold on to every last fat cell.)
  

      That’s why, when Oprah came out and said she was on a medication to help her lose weight and keep it off, I was really impressed. She has always been ahead of the curve with respect to weight loss. Not only has she shared the literal ups and downs of the scale, she was honest enough in the first place to admit that she struggles with her weight – something very few people, prominent or otherwise, are willing to do.
  

      So where is the inflection point? When will we start to see these medications as tools and not a sign of failure? And can we get to the point where we can be successful at weight loss – or accept ourselves the way we are — without shame?
  

      I don’t have any easy answers for you, but these are just some of the themes we’re going to touch on and conversations we’re going to have during this season of “Chasing Life.” I hope you join us as we search for answers.

And high body mass index topped the list of those risk factors. It was responsible for nearly a third of that sum: $238.5 billion.

Nearly 1 in 10 teens worldwide have used ineffective and potentially harmful weight-loss products, study estimates




      That was eight years ago, when our total health care expenditure was $2.7 trillion, according to the study. But health expenditures have only gotten larger: They grew by more than a trillion dollars between 2016 and 2022, when they hit $4.5 trillion, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts. Without throwing even more numbers at you, I think we can safely say we are paying a lot of money for health care ultimately caused by excess weight.
  

      But beyond the health care costs to society, there are real costs for individuals in terms of well-being, both physical and mental – and you can’t really put a price tag on that.
  

Almost 3 in 4 Americans 20 and older are classified as overweight or obese. But weight stigma is widespread, and our culture is steeped in blame and shame when it comes to weight.
  

      It creates relentless pressure on hundreds of millions of people to slim down, exercise more and conform to certain beauty standards that are hard for many to approximate, let alone achieve on an enduring basis. They’re admonished to “get healthy,” which is often code for “lose weight.”
  

      All the blood, sweat and tears do not even take into account the fact that the system we use to categorize people, body mass index, is flawed in the first place.
  

      When Belgian mathematician, statistician and astronomer Adolphe Quetelet developed the formula (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared equals BMI) in the 1830s, he was trying to figure out, statistically speaking, the size of an “average man.” And by that I mean average European male in the 1830s.

Insurance denials for popular new weight loss medications leave patients with risky choices




      The Quetelet formula was rebranded in 1972 as “body mass index” by physiologist Dr. Ancel Keys, who tried — and not without some controversy — to link body composition to health, disease and survival.
  

      The formula, as Quetelet imagined it, was never meant to be used as a diagnosis. It was never meant to be applicable to other global populations. It does not take into account factors such as general health, muscle vs. bone vs. fat, gender, age subcutaneous vs. visceral fat or other considerations. And the categories (“underweight,” “normal,” “overweight” and “obese”) have arbitrary cutoffs.
  

      “I can’t just judge the book by its cover and assume that someone [who] is larger is unhealthy and someone who is lean is healthy,” Stanford told me, referring to a person’s size and BMI. “That’s the assumption that people make. I call that practicing street-corner medicine.”
  

      She said she looks beneath the surface of the individual to assess their health – for example, with bloodwork and their functional ability — “because someone who’s lean may be very unhealthy, and someone who’s heavier may be healthier.”
  

    Has the cavalry arrived?


      Stanford’s approach embodies a new way for doctors to think about weight. It parallels the body positivity movement and the body neutrality movement, appreciating your body for what it can do. These cultural shifts have appeared to be nudging us all toward becoming more accepting of larger bodies without having to change them, as long as they are physiologically and functionally healthy.
  

      And then came a twist: the widespread adoption of a powerful and effective new class of medications originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Those drugs include semaglutide (sold as Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound) as well as the older liraglutide (sold as Victoza and Saxenda). It’s hard to overestimate their impact on popular culture – and on the bodies of those who take them.

CNN Exclusive: Older weight loss drugs are making a comeback as Zepbound, Wegovy remain out of reach for many




      As of September, 1.7% of the US population was prescribed semaglutide for either diabetes or weight loss, and that figure is only expected to grow. A projection from JP Morgan analysts says that by 2030, 9% of the country’s population will be on these medications. That’s 30 million Americans. And drugmakers are hard at work synthesizing even more powerful medications.
  

      These medications work by mimicking certain hormones our bodies release when we eat. When these hormones — or the drugs that mimic them – attach to receptors in our bodies, they are believed to do a number of things, including stimulating insulin production and signaling to our brains that we are satiated or full and can stop eating. One of the hormones, GLP-1, has also been shown to slow digestion so we feel fuller for longer.
  

      For anyone who has ever tried to diet, that’s a pretty big deal, especially the parts about feeling full for longer and telling your brain that your body is done eating.
  

      By many accounts, these new medications reduce “food noise” or “brain chatter,” intrusive thoughts about food, your next meal or that peach ice cream in the freezer. For many people, that food noise essentially creates the need for the constant exertion of willpower 24/7, an exhausting battle akin to walking around every day with a backpack full of rocks. (These drugs are so successful at quieting brain chatter that they’re being studied for other compulsive behaviors such as substance abuse, alcohol use disorder, smoking and gambling addiction.)
  

    A coming change in the way we think about obesity


      After covering medical news for more than two decades, I can say the introduction of these medications feels different. As with Prozac in the late 1980s and Viagra in the late 1990s, the arrival of these medications appears to be pivotal, maybe even revolutionary, because they work and seem to be safe, for the most part. That’s not to say some people don’t have unpleasant side effects and even, on occasion, very serious ones. Additionally, I should point out that when the drugs are stopped, the weight often returns, making these likely life-long drugs.

Rebel Wilson says she ‘lost focus’ on her health and regained 30 lbs.




      We are also in the middle of what I might call a paradigm shift in the way we think about the “disease” of obesity.
  

      There’s a new idea, not fully formed with all the data yet, that there are different types of obesity. Soon, these different subtypes may be thought of as distinct diseases, much like how breast cancer is no longer considered one disease but many. These subtypes of obesity don’t all have the same underlying biology or cause, nor do they necessarily respond to the same types of treatment.
  

      And that makes sense: We are not all built the same, and we have to take that into account. I know this from experience. My wife and I each wore a glucose monitor to track our blood sugar for a couple of weeks last year. Even though we both ate the same diet during that time, we found that certain foods caused our blood sugar to spike, and others did not – but it was different for each of us. I was sad to learn that one staple that spiked mine (but not Rebecca’s) is this Indian flatbread my mom makes; it’s a favorite of mine and my dad’s. (I shared this with my father, who has type 2 diabetes. He laughed and told me he already knew, because his glucose monitor had alerted him, as well!)
  

    Success and shame


      Even as we appear to be moving into a new phase of how we think about weight and weight loss in this country, thanks to changing attitudes and new medications, there’s still a fair amount of shame and stigma surrounding weight. They appear in two varieties.
  

      The first form comes if you don’t use these new medications and remain in a larger-than-culturally-accepted body — and to be clear, many people cannot access or afford the medications, others can’t tolerate them, and some don’t lose as much weight as they hoped.

FDA says it’s seized ‘thousands of units’ of counterfeit Ozempic




      The second form of shame comes if you do use them, because few people are willing to talk openly about it. It is rare for a celebrity to be forthright about doing so. It’s akin to admitting that you lack the willpower to do this on your own or that you’re taking the easy way out.
  

      We don’t place the same amount of shame on people who take medications for high cholesterol or high blood pressure. So why do we do this with weight loss medications, especially when most of us know from experience how hard it is to lose weight and keep it off?
  

      (In episode 2 of this season, we’ll investigate the evolutionary forces at work when we speak to Harvard paleoanthropologist Dr. Daniel Lieberman, who’ll explain why our bodies are built to hold on to every last fat cell.)
  

      That’s why, when Oprah came out and said she was on a medication to help her lose weight and keep it off, I was really impressed. She has always been ahead of the curve with respect to weight loss. Not only has she shared the literal ups and downs of the scale, she was honest enough in the first place to admit that she struggles with her weight – something very few people, prominent or otherwise, are willing to do.
  

      So where is the inflection point? When will we start to see these medications as tools and not a sign of failure? And can we get to the point where we can be successful at weight loss – or accept ourselves the way we are — without shame?
  

      I don’t have any easy answers for you, but these are just some of the themes we’re going to touch on and conversations we’re going to have during this season of “Chasing Life.” I hope you join us as we search for answers.

CNN
         — 
    


      Apple is offering temporary discounts on its iPhones and other products in China, in an extremely rare move for Apple that comes as competition within Asia’s smartphone market grows more intense.
  

      As part of a sale pegged to the Lunar New Year event, Apple’s official Chinese website is listing discounts of up to 500 RMB ($70) on the latest iPhone lineup. Other flagship Apple products, including the Mac and iPad, are also going to be discounted up to 800 RMB ($112) and 400 RMB ($56), respectively, as part of the promotion, which runs from January 18 through January 21.
  

      Although third-party sellers at times discount Apple products, Apple itself very rarely offers deals or sales, part of its effort to maintain a premium brand image – something that has been particularly important as Apple seeks to attract high-end buyers in China.
  

      The move to slash prices on the iPhone comes just over five months after Chinese tech giant Huawei released its latest smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro. The Huawei smartphone has been eagerly embraced by Chinese consumers – so much that its use of an advanced chip has come under scrutiny from US officials.
  

      Around the same time that Huawei’s marquis smartphone was released, the Wall Street Journal reported that China had banned the use of iPhones by central government officials, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. A Chinese government spokesperson, however, later denied that China had issued any laws or rules to ban the use of iPhones.
  

      The new discounts on the iPhone in China are raising fresh questions about how demand for Apple products is faring recently in the world’s second-largest economy. China has long been a key market for the iPhone maker, with roughly one-fifth of Apple’s overall sales last year coming from China.
  

      Sales for the iPhone 15 were down 4.5% in China compared to iPhone 14 sales in the first two weeks after its launch in September, according to Counterpoint Research. And last week, Jefferies Research in a note to clients said iPhone sales had tumbled 30% in the first week of the year, Reuters reported.


      China is one of Apple’s most important markets. It is second-largest in sales, behind only the North American market. But China’s economy has been struggling over the past year, hurting Apple’s overall growth. Last week, Apple lost its status as the stock market’s most valuable company, taking a back seat to Microsoft.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/business/hertz-tesla-selling/index.html,"Hertz is selling 20,000 electric vehicles to buy gasoline cars instead","CNN
         — 
    


      Hertz, which has made a big push into electric vehicles in recent years, has decided it’s time to cut back. The company will sell off a third of its electric fleet, totaling roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to purchase more gasoline powered vehicles.
  

      Electric vehicles have been hurting Hertz’s financials, executives have said, because, despite costing less to maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs and, also, higher depreciation. 


      “[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle,” Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst call.
  

      And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down the resale value of Hertz’s used EV rental cars.
  

      “The MSRP declines in EVs over the course of 2023, driven primarily by Tesla, have driven the fair market value of our EVs lower as compared to last year, such that a salvage creates a larger loss and, therefore, greater burden,” Scherr said.
  

      Simply put, people are generally willing to pay a certain amount less for a used car than for a new one. As the price of new car goes down, that also pushes down what people are willing to pay to buy a used one.
  

      Hertz expects to take a loss of about $245 million due to depreciation on the EVs, an average of about $12,250, per vehicle the company said in an SEC filing.
  

      While Hertz isn’t directly pointing a finger, it appears that Tesla has been largely to blame.
  

      Tesla makes up about 80% of Hertz’s EV fleet, and, altogether, EVs make up about 11% of Hertz’s total rental fleet. Tesla has been aggressively cutting its vehicle prices leading other automakers to do the same for their electric vehicles. When automakers reduce the prices of new vehicles, that pushes down the value of those models in the used car market, causing rapid depreciation.
  

      For rental car companies like Hertz, which sell lots of vehicles in the used car market, depreciation has a big impact on their business, and is a major factor when deciding which cars to have in their fleets.
  

      Being a relatively new company, Tesla doesn’t have as many replacement parts at hand and trained repair technicians that other car companies have, Hertz executives have said, making it costly and time-consuming to get repairs.
  

      Remember, in the likes of GM and other [automakers], there’s decades of establishment of a broad national parts supply network’” Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst call. “There’s an aftermarket of parts that is there, that is less mature, obviously, in the context of Tesla.”
  

      Besides costing more to repair when they’re damaged in a crash, Scherr also said, EVs are also getting in more crashes. Again, Teslas, which make up 80% of Hertz’s EV rental fleet, are mostly the problem in both these areas, he has said.
  

      “Our work with Tesla is to look at the performance of the car, so as to lower the risk of incidence of damage,” he said, “and we’re in very direct engagement with them on parts procurement and labor and the like.”
  

      Hertz sells its used vehicles at auctions as well as directly to customers on its Hertz Car Sales website."

CNN
         — 
    


      Boeing and US air travel are still facing the fallout a week after the dramatic in-flight door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 last Friday.
  

      The door plug — a portion of the plane’s fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door — detached from the plane and was later found in an Oregon backyard.


      171 Boeing Max 9s remain grounded in the United States as of Friday as airlines Alaska and United await updated emergency inspection guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration.
  

      The FAA said Thursday it is opening an investigation into Boeing’s quality control due to the failure of the door plug. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its own investigation, separate from the FAA.
  

      On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in an interview with CNBC that the door plug failure was a “horrible escape” of its manufacturing and quality control processes.
  

      When asked what happened, Calhoun told CNBC, “What happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out. That’s the mistake, it can never happen.”
  

      Here are the latest updates on Boeing and the effects of Alaska Air flight 1282.
  

Major cancellations throughout the US


      On Friday, the United States faced the highest number of cancellations in six months. That’s thanks to a combination of winter weather and the continued grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes.
  

      There were more than 2,000 cancellations as of Friday afternoon.
  

      Most of the cancellations are due to a winter storm that is pounding the Midwest. Chicago’s two major airports are seeing the bulk of the cancellations, with nearly 40% of departing flights at O’Hare and more than 60% of departing flights at Midway, according to FlightAware Friday afternoon.
  

      But the grounding of 737 Max 9 planes has exacerbated the issue. More than 200 United and Alaska Airlines flights have been canceled each day this week due to last Friday’s FAA-mandated grounding. The FAA and Boeing are still trying to settle on an inspection protocol that would allow those planes to resume flying.
  

FAA audits Boeing


      The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday its audit of the Boeing 737 Max 9 “production line and its suppliers” will focus on quality control.
  

      The audit will also assess “safety risks around delegated authority and quality oversight,” a practice that FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement “is time to re-examine.”
  

      Whitaker said the agency is also considering the use of a third party for the audit.
  

Class action lawsuit


      A class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in Washington state against Boeing on behalf of the passengers aboard last week’s Alaska Airlines flight 1282.
  

      According to the lawsuit’s allegations, “the event physically injured some passengers and emotionally traumatized most if not all aboard. The violence of the event bruised the bodies of some” and “passengers were shocked, terrorized and confused, thrust into a waking nightmare, hoping they would live long enough to walk the earth again.”
  

      Some of the plaintiffs listed in the lawsuit cited various injuries they allegedly suffered as a result of the incident, including “difficulty breathing,” “causing a concussion” and a loss of hearing.
  

      In addition to injuries, other damages were claimed such as “charges for evaluation and/or treatment of health conditions and associated travel expenses, ticket fees, costs associated with cancelation of travel plans, the value of lost personal items, lost wages,” etc.
  

      The lawsuit is requesting a trial to determine the damage amounts.
  

      Boeing did not have comment.
  

Aviation experts question door plug design


      Some aviation experts raised questions about the structural design of the section of the Boeing 737 Max 9 that blew off the plane.
  

      In interviews with CNN, the experts argued that if the door plug were designed to be larger than the opening it covers and installed inside the plane, the force of the pressurized air in the passenger cabin would force the plug against the plane’s interior frame and a situation such as the one on the Alaska Airlines flight could have been avoided. However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said.
  

      “It doesn’t make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,” said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst. “Historically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward… so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?”

CNN
         — 
    


      eBay will pay a $3 million criminal penalty for a harassment campaign, including sending live cockroaches, of a Massachusetts-based couple who ran a newsletter that was sometimes critical of the company.
  

      eBay was charged with six criminal offenses, including stalking, witness tampering and obstruction of justice, after several of the company’s employees sent disturbing packages to the home of Ina and David Steiner in 2019, including a bloody pig mask, a fetal pig, live insects and a funeral wreath.
  

According to a Massachusetts US attorney’s office statement, the $3 million settlement, announced Thursday, is the statutory maximum fine for eBay’s charges.
  

      The state’s acting US attorney, Joshua Levy, called eBay’s conduct “absolutely horrific” in the statement.
  

      “The company’s employees and contractors involved in this campaign put the victims through pure hell, in a petrifying campaign aimed at silencing their reporting and protecting the eBay brand,” Levy said.
  

      As part of its settlement, eBay will be required to retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for three years and enhance its compliance program.
  

      In a Thursday statement on the company website, eBay CEO Jamie Iannone called the company’s conduct in 2019 “wrong and reprehensible.”
  

      “We continue to extend our deepest apologies to the Steiners for what they endured. Since these events occurred, new leaders have joined the company and eBay has strengthened its policies, procedures, controls and training,” Iannone said.
  

      According to the US attorney’s statement, eBay employees, including Jim Baugh, eBay’s senior director of safety and security at the time, were frustrated with the tone of the Steiners’ newsletter, which aimed to provide information to eBay sellers. The intimidation campaign, which took place in August 2019, sought to push the couple to change the content of their newsletter.
  

      The disturbing packages included, according to a previous DOJ statement, “a box of live cockroaches,” “a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, and pornography.”
  

      The harassment of the couple by eBay employees didn’t stop at gruesome packages, though. The employees traveled to the Steiners’ home in Massachusetts to surveil them and install a GPS tracking device on their car. The employees also posted the couple’s address on Craigslist, inviting the public for sexual encounters at their home.
  

      “We left no stone unturned in our mission to hold accountable every individual who turned the victims’ world upside-down through a never-ending nightmare of menacing and criminal acts,” Levy said.
  

      Baugh, whom Levy called “the ringleader,” was sentenced to 57 months in prison in September 2022. Six other employees also face felony convictions for their involvement in the crimes.
  

      eBay said it terminated all involved employees in 2020, including the company’s former chief communications officer. The former chief communications officer has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing."

         — 
    


      More Americans are buckling under the weight of mounting credit card debt.
  

      All stages of credit card delinquency (30, 60 and 90 days past due) jumped higher during the third quarter of last year, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time, according to a report released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
  

      The Philadelphia Fed analyzed consumer credit card and mortgage data that large banks provide to the Federal Reserve on a quarterly basis.
  

      Philly Fed researchers found that 3.19% of credit card balances were 30 days late (up from 2.76% the quarter before); that 2.21% of balances were 60+ days delinquent (up from 1.91%); and that 1.52% were in serious delinquency of 90 days or more (up from 1.32%).
  

      As such, a greater share of people are revolving all or part of their credit card balance. As of the third quarter, 33.18% of accounts paid off their balance in full. That’s the lowest share since the fourth quarter of 2020, Philadelphia Fed data show.
  

      The delinquency rates exceeded those seen during the fourth quarter of 2019, and are close to setting a high for the data series that started in 2012, according to the report.
  

      “In response to this deterioration, banks are granting fewer credit line increases and reducing credit lines more frequently in the recent four quarters,” economist Gene Huang and senior analyst Anna Veksler wrote.

America’s final inflation report for 2023 just came in




      This nearly three-year stretch of high inflation and strong consumer spending has helped to send consumer debt — especially credit card balances — ballooning. In November, outstanding credit balances surpassed the $5 trillion mark for the first time, according to Fed data released earlier this week.
  

      The rising delinquencies are coming at time when debt is getting painfully expensive. Interest rates are the highest they’ve been in two decades, a direct effect from the Fed’s monetary policy tightening campaign.
  

      “Just paying 20%+ interest every month, the minimum payment math is brutal,” Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst with Bankrate, told CNN Business in an interview earlier this week.
  

      Borrowers making the minimum payment on an average credit card balance of $6,000 at the average rate of 20.74% would be in debt for more than 17 years and end up paying $9,000 in interest, Rossman said.
  

      It’s typically practical matters — that surprise medical bill, unexpected home or car repair, and day-to-day expenses — that get people into credit card debt, Rossman said.
  

      “That’s been all too common in the past couple of years with high inflation making gas and groceries and just about everything else more expensive,” he said. “It tends to be practical stuff, but it’s still a tough cycle to break.”"

      The Apollo is situated close to a flyover and next to a roundabout, but that didn’t stop fans braving the cold in west London to catch a glimpse of their heroes.
  

      Many had been lining up opposite the entrance of the green rather than red carpet – presumably because that’s the color of a football pitch – in the bitter cold since 8 a.m. to secure the best vantage point.

The love story that moved Lionel Messi: After her husband died she made sure to fulfill his dream




      “Oi, did you see Pep?” one excited fan asked his friend as Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola stepped onto the green carpet from his tinted taxi. The Spaniard went on to be crowned the Best Men’s Coach after guiding City to the treble last season.
  

      Romina Polenta, 34, from Argentina was one of the hundred or so fans who had gathered on the opposite side of the road to watch proceedings from afar.
  

      Polenta was there to support Lionel Messi, who was one of three stars nominated for the best male player award, alongside Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland.“
  

      “He [Messi] should always win,” Polenta told CNN Sport. “I’m a very partial [Messi] fan,” she jokes. “I don’t think he will win, I think Haaland will win, but he [Messi] should.”
  

      Polenta says she was in London when Messi led Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar in December 2022, adding that she “cried for 45 minutes” after the full-time whistle.
  

      “That was the only reaction I could have,” she says. “It was the best moment of my life. What he did for the country is something unbelievable.
  

      “There are no words to explain what he did for the country. I am assuming you saw the pictures of five million people celebrating on the streets [in Buenos Aires]? That is not normal – for anything in history.”

      Polenta was joined by her friend Johanne Perraud, 31, from France, who was naturally hoping to catch a glimpse of “Kiki,” Mbappé.
  

      However, Perraud didn’t want her compatriot to win the Best award: “Well, to support my friend, I think Messi should win.”
  

      The good news for Polenta and her friend is that later that evening Messi was crowned the FIFA Best Men’s Player, though the announcement was greeted by some surprised murmurs in the auditorium.
  

      It’s the second consecutive year that Messi has won the award, winning the previous accolade in the immediate aftermath of Argentina’s World Cup success at Qatar 2022.
  

      While few could argue with last year’s decision, the choice to award Messi the trophy again raised eyebrows, with the 36-year-old stepping away from top-flight football this year by joining Inter Miami in the MLS.
  

According to the world governing body, “Nominations for the awards were compiled by FIFA in collaboration with football stakeholders. Later, shortlists were determined by two separate panels of experts in men’s and women’s football. These panels comprised respected former players and coaches.”
  

    ‘It’s crazy to be close to players in real life’


      The somewhat fraught security outside the venue was in contrast to the laid-back atmosphere inside, with stars of the game milling around as they waited for the ceremony to begin.
  

      Players past and present were in attendance, including the likes of Brazilian great Ronaldo and the newly crowned Women’s Best Player, Aitana Bonmatí.
  

      Members of the media and a selection of special guests were confined to the upper echelons of the venue, able only to observe as the superstars engaged in small talk below.
  

      Also flitting around the theater, speaking and smiling at the camera on his phone, was content creator Oussama Nacer – or OussiFooty as he’s known on social media.
  

      Nacer boasts almost five million followers on TikTok and was in London to help produce FIFA’s social media output for the ceremony.
  

      “It’s crazy to be close to players in real life, you always watch them on TV or in a stadium but here, seeing them in real life at an awards ceremony, everyone dressed up nicely, I’ve also dressed up nicely, it’s really cool,” Nacer told CNN Sport, adding that he was slightly starstruck meeting World Cup winner and host Thierry Henry backstage.
  

      “For me, I love it, just to bring people closer to the event because normally they just watch it on TV. But seeing how it actually is, interacting with the players, showing them more content is what I love most.”

      The event kicked off with interpretive dancers and epic montages telling the story of the most-talked about moments from 2023, before the awards started being handed out.
  

      The year of 2023 in football is arguably most likely to remembered for Spain’s Jennifer Hermoso receiving an unwanted kiss from the country’s former soccer boss, Luis Rubiales, following the national team’s 2023 Women’s World Cup victory.
  

      The kiss was televised globally as Spain’s players lined up to receive their medals and congratulations from major political and football figures after their victory last August.

      Rubiales, then president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, was seen kissing Hermoso on the lips, then slapping her twice on the back, sparking an immediate outcry in Spain and internationally over consent.
  

      All of which perhaps explains why FIFA dedicated the awards to women’s soccer, with solely women in charge of handing out the trophies on stage.
  

      Sarina Wiegman, winner of the Best Women’s Coach award, used her acceptance speech to encourage more young girls to get into the game, an example followed by many of the winners that followed.
  

      As well as the handing out of the awards, the ceremony contained some genuinely heartwarming moments. Notably, the announcement that Brazil legend Marta would have a new award for the best goal scored in women’s football named after her, mirroring the Puskás Award in the men’s game.
  

      Marta holds the record for most goals scored at a men’s or women’s World Cup with 17 goals and a montage of some of her greatest moments played out on the giant screen behind her.
  

      “It makes me extremely happy to have the record, but it represents Brazil as a nation – not Marta, but all of us,” said the 37-year-old Brazilian. “It’s a huge honor for me to hold this record.
  

      “There’ll be no more World Cups for Marta. I’m very happy about how women’s football has evolved in Brazil and in the world.
  

      “There are girls bursting with talent who have a massive future in front of them. It’s just the start for them, while for me it’s the end of the line.”
  

      Additionally, Hugo Íñiguez, a huge fan of Argentine club Colón, received the FIFA Fan Award after adorable scenes of him bottle feeding his baby son on the terraces went viral last year.
  

      Íñiguez’s young son, dressed in a cute mini tuxedo, burst into tears as soon as his father got to the microphone, drawing laughs and aww’s from the crowd.
  

      After Íñiguez handed his son to his partner in the crowd, he went on to thank the cameraman, Salta Rodríguez, who captured the special moment."

         — 
    


Emma Raducanu made light work of her first grand slam match in almost a year, defeating Shelby Rogers in the first round of the Australian Open.
  

      The 21-year-old Raducanu endured an injury-plagued year in 2023 after undergoing wrist and ankle surgeries but impressed as she swept past Rogers 6-3 6-2 on Tuesday in just one hour and 16 minutes.
  

      “Being my first slam match back, it is definitely a little bit extra sweet,” Raducanu told reporters. “I knew going in Shelby’s a player with experience. She’s had some great wins in her career … I’m happy with the way I came through that today.”
  

      This was the British star’s third match since returning from injury, and she made a confident start by breaking Rogers’ serve and moving into a 4-1 lead before seeing out the set with a hold to love.

      Maintaining her high standard in the second set, Raducanu broke in the first game and consolidated her advantage with a further break at 3-1 when a backhand approach from the American landed in the net.
  

      A forehand winner from Raducanu closed out the set – and the match – to love once again, earning her a second-round meeting with China’s Wang Yafan on Thursday.
  

      Raducanu has battled with form and injuries in the years after she won the US Open as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021 and has not progressed beyond the second round of a grand slam since then.
  

      “It’s amazing to be pain-free with the wrists. I honestly didn’t know if I’d ever get to this stage,” she said, adding: “I had pain for so long … I think the time away made me very hungry. I’m just happy to be healthy again and pain-free.”
  

      Elsewhere in the women’s draw on Tuesday, world No. 1 Iga Świątek defeated 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin 7-6(7-2) 6-2, while third seed Elena Rybakina also progressed in straight sets, overcoming Karolína Plíšková 7-6(8-6) 6-4.
  

      Jessica Pegula, the top-seeded American at the Australian Open, is looking to produce a deep run at the tournament after reaching the quarterfinals three times in a row. She kicked off her campaign in Melbourne with a 6-2 6-4 win against Canada’s Rebecca Marino.

         — 
    


      Bill Belichick has interviewed for the vacant head coach role with the Atlanta Falcons, the team announced on Monday.
  

      Belichick – who left the New England Patriots last week after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl titles with the organization – has shown no sign of giving up on his coaching career, and an interview with the Falcons is a first step towards moving on from Massachusetts.
  

      This was Belichick’s first interview since leaving the Patriots and no deal is imminent, but there is mutual interest with ongoing conversations, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported on Monday.
  

      Belichick had extended playoff success during his time in Foxborough, something which the Falcons have not.
  

      The franchise has advanced to two Super Bowls in their history, the most recent coming in 2016 in which it held a 28-3 lead over Belichick’s Patriots, only for New England to mount a famous comeback and win 34-28.
  

      According to the Falcons, Belichick is one of six candidates the team has interviewed for the head coach job, including Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald, Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan, San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks, Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and Ravens assistant head coach/defensive line coach Anthony Weaver.
  

    Harbaugh to Los Angeles?


      Elsewhere, reigning NCAA national champion head coach Jim Harbaugh interviewed for the open head coaching job with the Los Angeles Chargers, the team announced on Monday.
  

      Harbaugh led the Michigan Wolverines to the national title with a 34-13 victory over the Washington Huskies earlier in January, completing an unbeaten 15-0 season and winning the program’s title first since 1997.
  

      The 60-year-old has been linked back to a return to the NFL though, with the Chargers the first team to interview him since the national championship win.

      Harbaugh has coached in the NFL before, spending four seasons as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
  

      In the 2012 season, he lost in Super Bowl XLVII – against his older brother and Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. In his four NFL seasons as a head coach, Harbaugh led the 49ers to the NFC championship game three times and had an overall record of 49-22-1, including 5-3 in the postseason.
  

      Harbaugh is one of many candidates who have been interviewed by the Chargers so far in their hiring process for the head coach role, a list which includes the team’s offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald, Baltimore offensive coordinator Todd Monken and Las Vegas Raiders defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, amongst others.
  

      According to NFL protocols, teams must conduct interviews with employees of other teams virtually prior to the conclusion of the divisional round of playoff games on Sunday, January 21. There are no limitations on teams conducting interviews with candidates who are employed by other teams."

         — 
    


      AS Roma has announced that José Mourinho and his coaching staff have left the Serie A club with “immediate effect,” with the Portuguese manager being replaced by club legend Daniele De Rossi.
  

      De Rossi, who played 616 times for Roma during an 18-year career with club, has been given a contract until June 30, 2024, Roma announced.
  

      “We are happy to be able to hand over the managerial role of AS Roma to Daniele De Rossi, as we feel that the leadership and ambition that have always defined him can prove decisive in achieving the team’s objectives until the end of the season,” Roma owners Dan and Ryan Friedkin said in a statement.
  

      “We were aware of Daniele’s unbreakable bond with the club, but his enthusiasm for accepting the position for the next few months convinced us even more of his ability to be a guide for the players and a proud representative of the club’s values. Welcome home, Daniele.”
  

      De Rossi will be in the dugout for Roma’s game against Verona on Saturday.
  

      The 60-year-old Mourinho was appointed Roma coach in May 2021 and guided the Italian team to a Europa Conference League final win a year later. Last year, Roma and Mourinho also reached the Europa League final but lost on penalties to Sevilla.

José Mourinho sent off after making ‘crying’ gesture as Roma scores dramatic winner




      Beaten 3-1 by AC Milan on Sunday, Roma is ninth in the Serie A table.
  

      “We would like to thank José on behalf of all of us at AS Roma for his passion and efforts since his arrival at the club,” said Dan and Ryan Friedkin – the club’s owners – in a statement.
  

      “We will always have great memories of his tenure at Roma, but we believe that an immediate change is in the best interests of the club.
  

      “We wish José and his assistants all the best in their future endeavours.”
  

      Mourinho is one of the most well known and successful managers in the game and has previously coached the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Porto.
  

      Roma’s Europa Conference final victory was the 26th trophy he has won in his managerial career. He has also won two Champions Leagues, a Europa League and a UEFA Cup.

      The role at Roma was the second time Mourinho had worked in Italy. When he was Inter Milan coach – between 2008-2010 – in his final season Mourinho guided the team to a remarkable treble – the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League."

         — 
    


      More than 130 Englishmen, 37 Scots and three Americans have sat down in a Premier League dugout. There have been Italians, Argentinians, Chileans and Swedes. There are three managers from Spain’s Basque Country in the league right now. However, the top flight of English soccer had never seen an Australian manager in its 31-year history – that is until the arrival of Ange Postecoglou.
  

      The 58-year-old Australian’s Premier League career might be in its infancy, but he has already turned a lot of heads since his appointment as Tottenham Hotspur manager.
  

      His media conferences have become box office viewing, while his team’s style of play is equally as watchable ever since this most unorthodox of coaches arrived in the promised land of the Premier League.
  

      When he landed at Scottish side Celtic in 2021 as a largely unknown coach, Postecoglou’s appointment was met with skepticism.
  

      There were doubts over his CV given Postecoglou had only managed in Australia, Greece and Japan until that point. But by the end of his two-year tenure with the Glasgow club, in which he won five out of the six trophies up for grabs, the doubters had made themselves scarce.

      The Australian was greeted with a similar reception when he was hired by London club Tottenham in the summer of 2023. Fast-forward a couple of months and Spurs fans are chanting, “We’ve got our Tottenham back.”
  

      Back home, Postecoglou is still revered for his efforts with the national team in the 2010s.
  

      “He’s inspired Australian football and inspired Australian football coaches,” Dr. Craig Duncan, one of the nation’s leading sports scientists who worked with Postecoglou during his tenure with the Socceroos – the Australian national team – told CNN Sport.
  

      So much so that, according to Duncan, many Australian football fans he has spoken to will immediately check the score of Tottenham’s matches when they wake up.
  

    The long way around


      Postecoglou was born in Athens, Greece, in 1965, before emigrating to Australia five years later with his family after his father lost his business in the Greek military coup in the late 1960s, according to BBC Sport.
  

      “You are talking about going half way around the world to a place where you literally don’t know a soul, you don’t know the language, you have no guarantee of any housing, any employment,” Postecoglou said to Sky Sports in 2021. “All they have really given you is a ticket.
  

      “I was very aware that we were different. My father, my mother, they literally had to make their way around without being able to talk. That leaves you, I guess, very isolated in many respects.”
  

      Postecoglou had a short playing career that saw him capped four times by the Australian national side, but he was forced into retirement at 27 due to a knee injury. He spent the entirety of his playing days with South Melbourne FC, a team formed by Greek immigrants.
  

      The club repaid Postecoglou’s loyalty by providing him with his first managerial position in 1996.
  

      He spent the next four years with the Victoria-based outfit before coaching Australia’s Under-17 and Under-20 national teams from 2000 to 2007.
  

      Despite some initial success, Postecoglou’s side failed to qualify for the 2007 FIFA Under-20 World Cup and sparked debate around his suitability for the position. He left the role as a result, but not before he had an infamous and heated on-air debate with former Australia international Craig Foster about his tenure.
  

      The impassioned argument lasted over 10 minutes, with Foster even calling on Postecoglou to resign.
  

      Postecoglou told the Open Goal podcast that the debacle had made him “unemployable” and spent the next couple of seasons coaching Panachaiki in the Greek third tier and semi-professional Australian team Whittlesea Zebras.
  

      Eventually, the Brisbane Roar of the A-League – Australia’s highest level of men’s soccer – took a chance on Postecoglou in the midst of the club’s worst ever campaign.
  

      In his first full season at the club, Postecoglou led the Roar to a first ever A-League title and the team successfully defended its crown the following year.
  

      A one-and-a-half-year stint with the Melbourne Victory followed before he was appointed as manager of the Australian national team in October 2013, leading the team in its trip to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup.

1996–2000: South Melbourne2000–2005: Australia U172000–2007: Australia U202008: Panachaiki2009: Whittlesea Zebras2009–2012: Brisbane Roar2012–2013: Melbourne Victory2013–2017: Australia2018–2021: Yokohama F. Marinos2021–2023: Celtic2023 – present: Tottenham Hotspur
  




      “When Australia was playing, there was a style of football,” Duncan told CNN. “It didn’t matter when and where we were playing, that was the football style that he would play.”
  

      After stepping down as Australia boss, Postecoglou was tasked with rebuilding Yokohama F. Marinos in Japan, before heading to Scotland to manage Celtic.
  

      Despite the perceived lack of big-club experience, Postecoglou has proved himself throughout his career as the man to call in a crisis, which perhaps explains why Spurs came calling after Antonio Conte’s spell in North London ended in acrimony.
  

    Attack, attack, attack


      Postecoglou’s sides play a high-octane, aggressive brand of soccer that focuses on pressing high up the pitch, regaining possession quickly after losing it and creating overloads in attacking spaces.
  

      “You can’t play Ange’s football if you’re not very good physically,” says Duncan. “A lot of it is having the right players that can physically do what he requires them to do.”
  

      Spurs also play a high defensive line which pins the opponent back and allows the ball to be regained higher up the pitch, though that strategy can leave Tottenham vulnerable to counter attacks.
  

      It’s an approach that has been praised as “brave” by some and criticized as “naïve” by others.
  

      However, Postecoglou’s unrelenting commitment to attacking soccer has won over many Spurs fans.

      “I think for anyone that loves football and its players, fans across the board, everybody wants to see goals,“ Ricky Sacks of the Last Word on Spurs podcast told CNN Sport. “Everybody wants to see a team attack. It’s the most exciting thing in football when you watch your team go forward.
  

      “The key thing now is that everyone turns up on a matchday really, really excited about what they’re going to watch,” said Sacks. “We’ve not had that feeling for a long time.”
  

      No matter how enjoyable the soccer is, though, all the praise means nothing if your team isn’t getting results.
  

      “This isn’t about us playing good football, it’s about us winning games of football,” Postecoglou told reporters after a recent 2-1 defeat by West Ham.
  

      Alongside his bold tactics, the Australian has also been credited with getting the most out of his squad, having overseen upticks in the performances of the likes of Pedro Porro, Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr.
  

    ‘Band of brothers’


      After Mauricio Pochettino took Spurs to the unimaginable heights of the Champions League final in 2019, it appeared as though the club was on the precipice of something special.
  

      But Pochettino was sacked later that year and the team went on to endure the tumultuous tenures of José Mourinho, Nuno Espírito Santo and Conte.
  

      Tottenham was in a spiral – and things somehow got worse. The club was plagued by a transfer saga in the summer of 2023 revolving around its all-time record goalscorer, Harry Kane, who was eventually sold to German side Bayern Munich the day before Spurs’ first game of the 2023/24 season.
  

      Alarm bells were ringing in north London, but Postecoglou has settled things down and set the club on a positive trajectory.
  

      “In comparison to last season, it looks like a really happy camp,” said Sacks. “Everybody is performing for each other. It looks like a band of brothers.”
  

      The Spurs squad has spoken positively of the manager since his arrival, while fans of all teams seem to appreciate his likeability and transparency.
  

      “What you see is what you get,” said Duncan. “He’s so good to work for because he’s absolutely a straight talker. He knows exactly what he wants and it’s so good because you can get on and do your job.”
  






The arrival of Postecoglou has also seen a return to form for recently appointed Tottenham captain Son Heung-min.

      Duncan describes Postecoglou as a leader who lets his players and staff do their jobs without micromanaging them.
  

      “He is very receptive, innovative and interested and he inspires you to be innovative as well,” he added.
  

      Sacks, who stresses that the club’s board needs to do its part and back Postecoglou in the transfer market, believes that the team is now back on the right track.
  

      “He’s been here for, what, four or five months? It feels like he’s been for four or five years because he’s built that bond already with supporters,” said Sacks. “He doesn’t cut corners. He doesn’t deviate. He tells you straight what to expect.
  

      “There’s that real human element to him where fans have that automatic connection to the manager.”
  

      Postecoglou appears to have completely changed the culture at Tottenham in his short period of time there and revitalized a fanbase which felt disconnected from the club just six months ago.
  

      As Sacks puts it: “Anything’s achievable at the moment and that’s down to Ange Postecoglou.”"

         — 
    


      Awards season is officially in full swing. After last week’s Golden Globes and Sunday’s Critics Choice Awards, the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards got underway at LA’s Peacock Theater on Monday — the third major red-carpet event in just eight days.
  

      Many of the same stars were in attendance, and several trends that emerged at recent ceremonies continued, with black and red outfits dominating once again.
  

      Actor and producer Katherine Heigl was there for a “Grey’s Anatomy” reunion and kept things classic with a scarlet Reem Acra dress and Marilyn Monroe-esque bob. “Succession” star Sarah Snook also channeled old Hollywood glamour in an elegant poppy-colored Vivienne Westwood gown, while British actor and musician Suki Waterhouse showed off her baby bump in a bright red Valentino Haute Couture gown with strategically placed side cut-outs.
  

      Those opting for elegant black outfits included Lizzy Caplan (in vintage Yohji Yamamoto), Christina Ricci (in plunging Saint Laurent) and Riley Keough (in Chanel). “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri was, meanwhile, among the evening’s best-dressed in a black Louis Vuitton leather bustier gown with a structured balloon skirt.

      It may only be January, but spring was definitely in the air on the Emmys red carpet. Plenty of attendees opted for fresh greens — from Jessica Chastain’s eye-catching chartreuse Gucci dress to “Ted Lasso” star Hannah Waddingham’s soft mint beaded Marchesa gown.
  

      Floral detailing was on show as well: On actor and comedian Ali Wong’s embroidered satin Louis Vuitton skirt, Simona Tabasco’s flower decoupage dress by Marni and her “The White Lotus” co-star Meghann Fahy’s custom Armani Privé dress, one of many to feature rose motifs.
  

      The theme carried over to menswear, too. Donald Glover, nominated as a writer for “Swarm,” wore a velvet top and pants with flower detailing by Bode. Awards host Anthony Anderson also put a fun spin on black-tie tradition in an Etro tuxedo with beaded lily design.

      Ellie Breaux of Texas placed as first-runner-up.
  

      Fifty-one contestants participated in the event, representing all 50 US states, as well as the District of Columbia.
  

      The pageant followed three nights of preliminary competitions. At the beginning of the main event, the field was narrowed to 11 semi-finalists — 10 chosen by the preliminary judges, and one by a public vote open to pageant fans and followers across the United States.

      These 11 women then participated in four rounds of competition — a fitness showcase (a runway walk in rhinestone-embellished athleisure); a “hot topics” discussion round, which replaced the pageant’s more traditional Q&A with a disparate set of talking points; a talent performance; and an evening gown presentation — before the five finalists were announced. Marsh and Breaux, who were followed in the final rankings by second-, third- and fourth-runners-up, Cydney Bridges of Indiana, Mallory Hudson of Kentucky and Caroline Parente of Rhode Island, respectively.
  

      In the somewhat disparate discussion round, which broached topics including terrorism, technology, nutrition and climate change, Marsh responded to the topic of “drugs in America” by recalling her late mother’s battle with pancreatic cancer. In the talent round, she presented a spoken-word piece centered on receiving a pilot’s license at 16.

         — 
    


      Irreplaceable art works by Picasso, Rembrandt, Goya and M.C. Escher are among those feared lost after a fire swept through a Seattle art gallery on Friday, the gallery’s manager told CNN.
  

      Authorities believe someone started a fire in the alley behind the gallery to warm themselves and it spread into the three-story building. Firefighters responded to 911 calls at 6:39 a.m. Friday, the Seattle Fire Department said. At that time, temperatures in the area hovered in the low 20s.
  

      No injuries were reported in the fire, which investigators have since ruled accidental.
  

      “Much of the work, we hope, will be saved. We’re triaging them now,” Davidson Galleries manager Rebecca McDonald said. It may take weeks for the gallery to determine the fate of the works of the famed artists.
  

Davidson Galleries specializes in works on paper – specifically etchings, lithographs and wood cuts, owner Sam Davidson told CNN. He had amassed between 16,000 to 18,000 pieces over the past 50 years.
  

      The oldest piece in the collection dates back to 1490, while the newest pieces were created just last week, McDonald said.
  






No injuries were reported in the fire, which investigators have since ruled accidental.

      The gallery was just weeks away from a planned move of their inventory from downtown Seattle’s Pioneer Square to a new location several blocks away. Several artworks were laid out on the floor in preparation of the move, making them more exposed to potential smoke damage.
  

      “I feel saddest for the contemporary artists who have trusted us with their works,” Davidson said. “Until I got there and saw it myself, I didn’t get the full impact. It is very dramatic when you walk in the gallery. It’s just so black in there.”
  

      The smoke damaged some artworks, the gallery team said in a Facebook post updated Sunday. “We are currently in the process of assessing the extent of the damage. However, it was not as extensive as initially thought, and we are hopeful that we will be able to preserve the vast majority of our inventory,” the post read.

      Many pieces in the collection were in drawers, while others were covered with rag mats and a sheet of mylar that may have protected them from smoke damage, said McDonald, who also credited the responding firefighters.
  

      “The firefighters were wonderful,” she said. “They were very judicious about using water when they realized they were in gallery.”
  

      The fire started at the back of the gallery, once the flames were doused, the firefighters “protected the works carefully, packing them outside,” McDonald said.
  

      In the aftermath of the fire, firefighters and artists alike gathered to help move the art works.
  

      “It’s the wonderful part of the art community, that they come together when there’s a need,” Davidson told CNN affiliate Kiro 7."

         — 
    


      British supermodel Kate Moss turns 50 today — and she remains as much a cultural icon as when she emerged as a breakout star more than three decades ago.
  

      South London born Moss was scouted by a leading model agent at 14, and began appearing in magazines and commercials at 16. As she celebrates her milestone birthday, it’s not hard to see why she is still as revered as one of Vogue’s favorite cover stars.


      “She was just this cocky kid from Croydon,” recalled photographer Corinne Day, who captured Moss for her first Vogue cover in March 1993 during an interview with Vogue. “She wasn’t like a model… but I knew she was going to be famous.”
  



‘Everyone is in the same boat’: Is designing fashion worth going into debt?




      What followed was a meteoric rise to fame, where the waifish, 5-foot-7-inch Moss became the face of the infamous ’90s fashion trend “heroin chic” — a grungy contrast to the glamorous, leggy look popularized by fellow supermodels of the day, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer.
  

      Soon, Moss was fronting campaigns for high-end fashion houses including Burberry, Chanel and Calvin Klein.
  

      Throughout her long and storied career she has appeared on more than 40 covers of British Vogue. Though, arguably, it was her off-set appearances that captured the public’s attention as much as her more polished photoshoots. The model’s penchant for vintage clothing and her seemingly effortless ability to put together unique outfits earned her the often-repeated label of “global style icon.”

      Even appearances at the UK’s rain-soaked Glastonbury festival started trends — her ability to make knee-high muddy rain boots work with ultra-short denim cut-offs spawned an ongoing, decades-long “festival dressing” trend before “going viral” online was even possible.
  



Smiles, purpose and ‘pickling:’ Julia Roberts talks timeless beauty in British Vogue




      Legendary photographer David Bailey, who has taken some of the most iconic shots of Moss, previously explained to CNN why she is so successful: “Kate has a unique beauty that is totally democratic and has a universal appeal.”
  

      Moss’ life has long been the subject of tabloid speculation. In addition to high-profile romances with Johnny Depp, magazine editor Jefferson Hack and The Libertines front man Pete Doherty, her alleged drug use was widely reported by the British media in 2005, leading her to lose lucrative modelling contracts with Burberry, Chanel and H&M.
  

      She later issued a public apology and, that fall, voluntarily entered a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona. (“I felt sick and was quite angry, because everybody I knew took drugs,” she recalled to the BBC in a rare radio interview in 2022. “So for them to focus on me, and to try to take my daughter away, I thought was really hypocritical.”)
  

      Moss later went on to climb Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s highest-paid models. Since officially retiring from the runway in 2004, she has set up her own modeling agency, as well as her own wellness brand, Cosmoss.
  

      She has been immortalized in gold by Marc Quinn, in what the artist claimed was the largest gold statue since Ancient Egypt, and painted by Lucian Freud. She has even appeared in music videos for the likes of Johnny Cash, Paul McCartney, Primal Scream, The White Stripes and Elton John, helping secure her place in pop culture history.

         — 
    


      Carrying lunch into the office from home can be one way to save money — except, perhaps, when it is stored in Pharrell Williams’ Louis Vuitton sandwich bag costing over $3,000.
  

      Record producer and designer Williams, who was named men’s creative director of the French luxury fashion house last February, has seemingly drawn inspiration from the classic paper sandwich bag for one of his latest designs, reimagining it as a high fashion accessory.

      Instead of paper, the large clutch bag — seen tucked under the arms of models on the runway during Williams’ debut collection on the Pont Neuf in Paris last June — is made of cowhide leather “in exactly the same color as the house’s famed (paper) shopping bags,” the label said.
  

      The comparisons don’t end there. Precisely folded to resemble its more quotidian counterpart, the accessory also features the iconic Louis Vuitton lettering as well as a blue fastening, evoking the grosgrain handles of the house’s bags, to keep sandwiches — or more likely, something more precious — secure.
  



Why the Balenciaga Ikea-inspired bag story isn’t new




      The piece went on sale January 4 exclusively at the brand’s West Hollywood pop-up store, retailing for $3,130. But it’s not the first time that Louis Vuitton has drawn inspiration from everyday (and, traditionally, much cheaper) accessories.
  

      In its Spring-Summer 2007 collection, the fashion house paid homage to the budget-friendly checkered plastic laundry bags beloved the world over. In 2022, the brand also released a cross-body bag resembling a paint can (complete with metal handle), “decorated with playful references to Louis Vuitton’s heritage.”

      The paint can bag was designed by Louis Vuitton’s late creative director Virgil Abloh who, in a 2021 interview with design magazine “Icon,” cited the artist Marcel Duchamp — renowned for transforming everyday objects into art — as one of his heroes.
  

      Other fashion houses have employed this approach too: In 2014, designer Ashish Gupta revamped the plastic grocery bag into a sequined statement piece at a premium price, saying that it paid “homage to everyday life.”
  

      “It’s also perhaps a revolt against the disposable nature of fast fashion,” Gupta added in a 2017 email to CNN. “It’s taking a classic but throw-away object and turning it into something with longevity, that can be appreciated outside of its usual context for its timeless design quality.”
  

      But such designs can court controversy — and ridicule. In 2017, Balenciaga released a $2,145 bag that looked just like Ikea’s iconic 99 cent crinkly, blue “Frakta” bag, and promptly went viral on social media.

      As fighting continues between Israel and Hamas, many may wonder why this war — and, more broadly, the decades-long Israeli–Palestinian conflict — is so intractable. As far as the current war is concerned, third parties like the UN, US and Qatar have had only minor tactical successes such as the brief hostage and prisoner exchange that prevailed at the end of November.

      As for the longer conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which has persisted since 1948, long-term peace today seems no closer than it did 75 years ago. Why is it so difficult to resolve this conflict? Why have so many peace efforts, pursued by so many governments and leaders over the decades, only led back to war?
  

      The answer goes beyond geopolitics and speaks to the underlying psychology of what it is to be human and why we fight. Thankfully, the research on this psychology also points to potential pathways to resolution.
  

      To be clear, geopolitics does matter: Power struggles among leaders, foreign actors’ cynical use of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict for their own domestic interests, economic motives, strategic and ideological alliances all have worked against peace. But these factors are influenced by and further influence deeper psychological impulses that exist across various conflicts but combine in vicious cycles in Israel and Palestine, leading to perpetual violence.
  

      Here are key psychological concepts that have been studied in the Israeli–Palestinian context and what they mean for conflict resolution.
  

Parochial altruism: with us or against us


      Humans have well-established in-group and out-group biases. These general tendencies still allow for us to be an extremely cooperative species, but the problem arises when these biases begin to polarize. Humans find trouble when they go to the extreme of altruism (by showing favoritism to one’s own group) while simultaneously going to the extreme of parochialism (by displaying hostility toward those outside it). When strong forms of parochial altruism arise on all sides of a conflict, intractability sets in.
  

      It is believed that parochialism and altruism co-evolved in humans through repeated warfare. When another group threatens our existence, the best survival strategy is to bond as cohesively as possible with our in-group. This is oftentimes accompanied by perceiving one’s own group as morally superior or pure while overly villainizing or dehumanizing the other group. This creates a stark contrast between the good “us” and the evil “other.” This in turn justifies using excessive violence against the other side, including against their civilians. This can manifest in being cavalier about copious “collateral damage,” or even worse, in intentionally targeting civilians.

      We can see this clearly in Hamas’ numerous terrorist attacks against civilians and their active dehumanization of Jews in their rhetoric and even in school books used to teach children. We can see it in Israel’s minister of defense bringing the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza to near starvation through a complete siege and justifying it by saying the Israel Defense Forces are “fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,” or the now-suspended Israeli minister of Jerusalem affairs suggesting Israel could drop an atomic bomb on the Gaza Strip. The logic of the latter appears to be on a par with Hamas’: Our survival depends on the others’ annihilation.
  

Sacred values: never compromise


      Of course, most Israelis and Palestinians don’t think like this. But there are myriad factors that make someone take on this hostile mode of thinking. Chief among those factors is a dogmatic ideology that makes compromise with the other side seem like a morally abhorrent notion.
  

      This kind of ideology is infused with what are called “sacred values.” These are values of such moral importance that they transcend the material concerns of everyday life; people would be willing to give their lives for them. Israelis and Palestinians hold values that come into direct conflict with each other such as claims over land.
  

      Within the bounds of modern-day Israel and the Palestinian territories are areas considered to be Holy Land by Abrahamic faiths. Wars have been fought on and off consistently over competing claims to its sanctity. Some are willing to accept its shared sacredness while others believe it belongs rightfully to their group alone. But a dispute over sacred land is not all about religion. It can and has been co-opted into politics, and that is from where much of the conflict emanates.
  

      At one extreme end are Hamas, whose leader at the time, Khaled Meshaal, said in 2017 that “we shall not waive an inch of the Palestinian home soil.” On the other end is the Israeli minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich, who just this July, in his dual role as head of the Defense Ministry’s Settlements Administration, laid out his plans for the annexation of the West Bank. In March, he spoke next to a map of “Greater Israel” that included parts of Jordan, while arguing against Palestinian statehood “because there’s no such thing as the Palestinian people” and because the Palestinian people are, in Smotrich’s words, an “invention.” When incompatible values like these become sacred, compromise becomes exceedingly difficult.
  

      A feature of sacred values is that they cannot be traded-off with profane values like material incentives to compromise. This poses a serious issue for peace negotiations. When third parties (e.g., the UN, US, etc.) try to help negotiate peace deals, their main tools for (dis)incentivization are material in nature, such as foreign aid and sanctions. A study led from the New School for Social Research investigated how Israelis and Palestinians would react to a two-state solution deal. The sample included Jewish Israeli settlers and Palestinians who identified with Hamas.
  

      Generally, both sides did not support the deal on offer. When each side was offered foreign aid to incentivize the deal, it produced a backfire effect among those who held sacred values. Those found by the researchers to be “moral absolutists” about particular issues — like Israel conceding land to Palestinians or allowing Palestinian refugees to return home — were more likely to experience anger and disgust at the deal and more likely to endorse violence against it when foreign aid was added to the mix. Meaning, adding foreign aid as an incentive to accept the deal only made things worse.
  

      So how does one incentivize a peace deal among those who hold opposing sacred values? Luckily, there is an answer.
  

      In the same study, the researchers tested the effect of symbolic concessions. These included things like Israel apologizing for the wrongs done to the Palestinian people for all these past years, and Palestinians recognizing the legitimacy of Jewish people’s right to the land of Israel. When a symbolic concession was offered, those holding sacred values were less angered and disgusted by the deal, and support for violent opposition plummeted.

      Third-party mediators look at conflicts through the lens of business-style negotiations, where hard facts must be addressed when it comes to hostages, land, militarization, and so on. While these facts do need to be discussed, the research points to the importance of social-emotional needs being addressed first, as they underpin the unwillingness to compromise on the material issues. Carrot-and-stick policies, such as the promise of foreign aid coupled with the threat of sanctions, backfire when presented to those holding sacred values. By contrast, symbolic concessions flip this pattern and act as precursors to further pragmatic negotiations.
  

Trauma and victimhood: The past is never past


Collective trauma only makes resolving this conflict more difficult. For both sides, the current violence brings back traumatic memories. For Israelis, the attacks on October 7th — and events afterwards such as the storming of an airport in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, where a mob searched for Jewish passengers, or the October firebombing attack on a Berlin synagogue — reminds them of the pogroms Jews faced at the hands of the Nazis and others.
  

      For Palestinians, the war driving people out of their homes and into the streets and refugee settlements harkens back to the Nakba in 1948, when Palestinians were left as a stateless people during the creation of Israel. Collective traumas become part of the story each group tells about itself. They can also be a barrier to resolution by causing some to resist compromise, in order to not let the past repeat itself.
  

      This reaction can be amplified by something called competitive victimhood. As the name suggests, each side competes for who is the greater victim. The competition is not always explicit, but one can hear it as an element in the discussion of this current war. Israelis point out that they suffered an unprovoked attack that killed over 1,200 people and saw more than 240 hostages taken by Hamas into Gaza. Palestinians note that their victimization goes far back, through decades of subjugation.
  

      Whether it’s acknowledged or not, this competition can lead to an infinite regress, where each side points to an earlier historical fact to demonstrate its greater victimhood and thereby entitlement to greater sympathy. In addition, denying each other’s collective traumas is tantamount to questioning each other’s collective identities and is experienced as re-victimization. This creates a dynamic where each side expects the other to make the first and greater concession, which often leads to a stalemate.
  

      Researchers at Tel Aviv University conducted experimental surveys of Israelis and Palestinians and found that simply acknowledging each other’s traumas can reduce competitive victimhood and increase reconciliation. In these studies, Israeli Jews were presented with information about Palestinians acknowledging the Holocaust as a major victimizing event, while Palestinians were told about Israeli Jews acknowledging the suffering related to the Nakba. What the researchers found: Having one’s own collective trauma acknowledged increased willingness to acknowledge the other side’s traumas, thereby reducing competitive victimhood. Even more surprising, this reciprocal acknowledgment led to both sides being more willing to compromise on contentious issues like the partition of Jerusalem, Israeli West Bank settlements and Palestinian “right of return.”
  

The way forward: Thankfully, the tools exist


      Depressing as the last three months have been, the psychological literature makes clear that tools do exist to make peace more possible. Symbolic concessions decrease barriers to resolution, even among absolutists. Acknowledging each other’s traumas reduces competitive victimhood and increases willingness to compromise on contentious issues. Those elements of dialogue are important for opening the door to discussion of any particular peace plan.

      These tools can only be used if leaders on both sides agree to a cessation of violence and sincerely want peace. Such is not the case when war rages on and a group like Hamas identifies itself with the destruction of Israel, and a leader like Netanyahu indicates (as he did in 2019) that a strong Hamas is good for Israel as it provides justification for avoiding peace.
  

      The research all points in one direction: the need to publicly and unequivocally accept each other’s realities and thereby dignify each other’s humanity. Once that happens, pragmatic negotiations related to material disputes can be undertaken. But until then, strong psychological levers will continue to work against peace."

      Researchers at Tel Aviv University conducted experimental surveys of Israelis and Palestinians and found that simply acknowledging each other’s traumas can reduce competitive victimhood and increase reconciliation. In these studies, Israeli Jews were presented with information about Palestinians acknowledging the Holocaust as a major victimizing event, while Palestinians were told about Israeli Jews acknowledging the suffering related to the Nakba. What the researchers found: Having one’s own collective trauma acknowledged increased willingness to acknowledge the other side’s traumas, thereby reducing competitive victimhood. Even more surprising, this reciprocal acknowledgment led to both sides being more willing to compromise on contentious issues like the partition of Jerusalem, Israeli West Bank settlements and Palestinian “right of return.”
  

The way forward: Thankfully, the tools exist


      Depressing as the last three months have been, the psychological literature makes clear that tools do exist to make peace more possible. Symbolic concessions decrease barriers to resolution, even among absolutists. Acknowledging each other’s traumas reduces competitive victimhood and increases willingness to compromise on contentious issues. Those elements of dialogue are important for opening the door to discussion of any particular peace plan.

      These tools can only be used if leaders on both sides agree to a cessation of violence and sincerely want peace. Such is not the case when war rages on and a group like Hamas identifies itself with the destruction of Israel, and a leader like Netanyahu indicates (as he did in 2019) that a strong Hamas is good for Israel as it provides justification for avoiding peace.
  

      The research all points in one direction: the need to publicly and unequivocally accept each other’s realities and thereby dignify each other’s humanity. Once that happens, pragmatic negotiations related to material disputes can be undertaken. But until then, strong psychological levers will continue to work against peace."

CNN
         — 
    


      When I speak to Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish on the phone, his voice is heavy with jetlag and grief.
  

      Abuelaish — known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital — has just returned to his adopted home of Toronto.
  

      For the past few days he’s been in Cairo, comforting his brother who is mourning the loss of three of his children killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike.
  

      “Even if he could get back,” Abuelaish says of his brother who left Gaza for Egypt in September for health reasons, “he doesn’t have anything to go back to.”
  

      It’s a sorrow Abuelaish knows painfully well. In 2009, he shot to fame after describing live on Israel’s Channel 10 TV the horror of discovering three of his own daughters — aged 21, 15 and 13 — and his 17-year-old niece, killed after an Israeli tank strike on their home in Gaza.
  

      For weeks, Abuelaish had been delivering regular updates to Israeli television in his fluent Hebrew on the intense Israel-Hamas fighting happening in Gaza at the end of 2008/start of 2009.
  

      Then on January 16, he called his friend and Channel 10 reporter Shlomi Eldar, who put his message on speaker phone, live on TV.
  

      It was a moment of television that shook the presenters — and Israeli audiences — to the core.
  

“My God, My God, what have we done?” wailed a grief-stricken Abuelaish from the phone held aloft, of his mutilated children.

      With the help of Shlomi, other injured members of Abuelaish’s family were evacuated to an Israeli hospital. And in his anguish, Abuelaish used the media spotlight to advocate for equality and peace.
  

      He later wrote a memoir of his experience: “I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor’s Journey on the road to Peace and Human Dignity.” The five-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee, 68, emigrated to Canada with his remaining children, and is now a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.


      But almost 15 years after his harrowing phone call on live TV, Abuelaish is again grappling with family tragedy following Israeli bombardment in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack.
  

      This time, more than 20 members of Abuelaish’s extended family were killed after an airstrike on the Jabalya refugee camp in late October. (The Israel Defense Forces say the strike was targeting Hamas members).
  

      In this interview with CNN Opinion, Abuelaish reflects on his reasons for wanting to work alongside Israeli doctors, the dire situation for hospitals in Gaza now, and why he sees his own daughters in the faces of every Palestinian child.
  

The interview has been edited for clarity and length. 


CNN: Tell me about your early years growing up in Jabalya refugee camp, Gaza.


Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish: There is nothing called “life” there. You are waiting for humanitarian aid. You go to sleep starving. Water, you have to collect it.
  

      But at least, at that time public water was available. These days, there is no water. There is no food. It’s abject poverty. It’s deprivation. You feel the despair, the frustration of the people there.
  

      In 1970, our house was demolished by the Israelis. What is home? Home is your dignity. Home is your freedom, your privacy, your family, your life. It’s more than just the four walls.
  

      It was a very simple home — two rooms. But it was protecting us from winter, and from the sun.
  

      Once the home is gone, the dignity, freedom, privacy are gone with it.
  

CNN: You are known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital — what did you learn from working on the other side of the border?


Abuelaish: Doctors, for me, are messengers of humanity. They spread humanity, they heal the wounds. And when we treat patients, we treat them equally, based on the diagnosis. Not based on the name, ethnicity, religion, background.
  

      That’s what I practiced. And that’s what I’m proud of.
  



        Why do we treat patients equally inside hospitals and then once they step outside they are treated differently?
    

            Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish
        


      Why do we treat patients equally inside hospitals and then once they step outside they are treated differently?
  

      When I went to work there, I wanted the Israelis to learn, and to understand, and to know who the Palestinians are. Because our enemies are our ignorance, arrogance and greed. How can I judge you without knowing you? Without dealing with you?
  

      I wanted the Israelis not to see the Palestinians as workers working for them, or only to see them in the child who is throwing stones during the First Intifada. I want them to see the Palestinians as equal, as talented, as human as they are.
  

CNN: In 2009, your phone call to Israeli TV relayed the horror of your three daughters and niece killed after an Israeli tank shell hit your home in Gaza. How did this moment shake Israelis?


Abuelaish: During that time [of intense Israel-Hamas fighting from Dec 2008 to January 2009], every day, every night, we can’t approach the windows because of the bombing, shelling, all around us.
  

      And now, it’s much worse than what we experienced then.
  

      I had six daughters and two sons. So I used to put them: three beside one wall, three beside the other, and we remaining on another wall, in case a strike should come from one side and not all of us be killed.
  

      That day, when I saw the smoke, the dust, the damage, at first I didn’t believe it. But then I realized, it’s my home.
  

      I went inside to see where is Bessan, my eldest daughter, who took the role of the mother after her mother passed away? (Abuelaish’s wife had died of leukemia the previous year).
  

      Where’s Mayar? Who was 15 and planned to be a medical doctor. She was decapitated.
  

      Aya, who was 13 and planned to be a journalist. And my niece Noor, who was 17, and came this evening to be with us, and who planned to be a teacher.
  

      They became parts. Slaughtered, scattered everywhere. The brains, the blood, on the roof, the ceiling, on the ground.

‘The cry of the newborn baby is a cry of hope’: Bereaved Palestinian doctor on Gaza, grief and peace




      So at that moment, what can I do? I was supposed to be interviewed live by Israeli TV about the situation in the Gaza Strip. When I called my friend the journalist telling him what happened, I left him a voice message. Fortunately, he was sitting with the TV anchor who was supposed to interview me.
  

      He told her, something has happened with Dr. Abuelaish. He put it on loud speaker — I didn’t know what was happening there in the studio — and I asked him, what can be done to stop the shooting of the house, to evacuate those who were killed and the causalities.
  

      My daughter Shatha, with her eye ruptured and two fingers completely torn. She was gasping. So at that moment I called, to see if I can take then to the hospital where I am working. And then it was broadcast live to Israel — opening a closed box.
  

      It showed them: these are Palestinian people. This is the doctor who is treating us, delivering our babies. These are his daughters who are peace activists.
  

      So they opened the borders for us. I went to the hospital.
  

      Once it was broadcast live, it came to symbolize the war. Two days later, Ehud Olmert, who was the prime minister, who knows me, he announced a unilateral ceasefire.
  

      At least this satisfied me. It helped to save lives. But no one should be killed in order for that to happen.
  

CNN: Having worked in Palestinian hospitals throughout your career, paint a picture of the challenges they will be facing now.


Abuelaish: About 25 hospitals are not functioning, they are demolished. And the others are functioning minimally. (According to World Health Organization assessments as of December 27, Gaza has 13 partially functioning hospitals, 2 minimally functioning ones, and 21 that are not functioning at all).
  

      The most important things you need for a hospital to work are human resources, facilities and security.

How Gaza’s hospitals became battlegrounds




      Also, electricity is vital. It is an integral part of any hospital. What is needed for these destructive wounds from these merciless attacks? We need to do an X-ray, and an X-ray needs electricity.
  

      You need a lab. You need a blood transfusion, so you need a blood bank. You need anesthesia and you need to operate in a theater.
  

      You need water, antibiotics, medication.
  

      And what about the patients with chronic diseases? Things like bronchial asthma, heart disease, diabetes, cancer.
  

      Speaking as a gynecologist, with the current situation, what does this mean for women who are pregnant? How can they deliver without sanitation? Or imagine a caesarean section without anaesthesia.
  

CNN: You’ve said that you see your daughters in every Palestinian child. What does the future look like for Palestinian children now?


Abuelaish: There is no future for them. How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?
  

      The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.
  

      It’s ongoing, persistent, transgenerational stress disorder.

      We need to change the context and environment which led to this. We need to equalize the Palestinians and the Israelis — not as “occupier” and “occupied,” “oppressor” and “oppressed.” But as equal people, side by side.
  

      This is the guarantee to help our Palestinian children. And also the Israeli children. To move forward and build a future.
  

CNN: What life do you dream of for your family in Gaza? And how can that possibly be achieved?


Abuelaish: Since the war, they have been like nomads. They have moved about 10 times, from one place to the other, scattered everywhere.
  

      So what I wish for them, is for the world to think of them. Thinking of those who are waiting to drink fresh water, to have shelter.

      Freedom should never stop at the borders of the Palestinian people. And I want the world to understand that the Palestinian people deserve it. They are educated and talented people who can share in the world’s development and progress.
  

      Life is like riding a bicycle — to keep balanced, we must keep moving. We as Palestinian people have been challenged and we are ready to start from zero.
  

      But we need this zero to be attached, accompanied and translated into freedom, dignity and equality."

CNN
         — 
    


      Oprah Winfrey recently disclosed that she had taken weight-loss medication, and some Americans felt betrayed.  How could she, the queen of WeightWatchers and doyenne of dieting, be abandoning the equation of diet + exercise = slim? Maybe because Oprah is conceding an uncomfortable truth: Diets rarely work. It doesn’t matter how much grit or willpower you have or how hard you’re willing to work, the weight comes back; it nearly always does.

      If Oprah’s army of chefs and trainers couldn’t transform her into a size 6 without drugs, then maybe it’s time to question the tired American (diet) dream that hard work = success and redefine success altogether.
  

      Dieting is a theory and a practice. In theory, we’re desperate to believe our bodies bend to our will and health is infinitely improvable. In practice, we watch our bodies break and bend. We age. Cancer comes. Tragedy strikes. We all get sick from something. Still, diets often give people hope – if not health – to do hard things and take a first step toward something bigger. In fact, studies find that deciding to diet makes people feel stronger, just like deciding to exercise makes would-be-exercisers feel taller.
  

      This year, let’s remember our bodies are not evidence of our human value. Taking  weight-loss drugs, rejecting diet culture or choosing to diet are all valid health decisions. Oprah’s prescription for weight-loss drugs reveals nothing about her work ethic. Rejecting diet culture wholesale is powerful and empowering. And going on a diet can be fulfilling, inspiring dieters to do hard things, or at least feel stronger while they try.

Opinion: These people are fat. It’s none of your business




      But these decisions are often ridiculed. Oprah told People magazine the weight-loss medication “feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for.” People are fat-shamed and shamed for not doing anything about their weight but suffer through a diet. Memes mock those with “Ozempic face” for their gaunt expressions; with anonymity, some Reddit users call these drugs the easy way out; Jimmy Kimmel made weight loss drug users  the butt of the joke at the 2023 Oscars.
  

      These critics are clinging to an illusion: the American diet dream that hard work equals success and medication turns hardworking dieters into lazy cheats. In fact, diets have long embraced pleasure, not suffering, and many diets reject hunger altogether (case in point: the 1966 Martinis and Whipped Cream diet or the historic 1972 Atkins “no-hunger diet”). Even more, weight loss has long been a by-any-means-necessary racket, with little integrity to compromise.

      Just look at the tragic history of diet drugs. Introduced in 1907, the thyroid gland extract Marmola remained a popular obesity remedy even after doctors discovered that it caused speeding heart rates and insomnia. Doctors only stopped prescribing the deadly dinitrophenol (DNP) in 1938 when the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act labelled the drug “extremely dangerous.” (Still, dieters are dying from illegal DNP purchased over the internet).
  

      Amphetamines and methamphetamines were touted as effortless and easy ways to lose weight for much of the mid-20th century. In the 1990s, the drug fen-phen was similarly regarded as a miracle diet cure until the FDA forced a withdrawal.


      Exercise has similarly changed over time. Unlike the “no pain, no gain” mentality today, many 18th and 19th century fitness enthusiasts recommended sailing, standing, rocking, bathing, fishing, massage, shampooing, waving flags, trips to the Turkish bath and rides in horse-drawn carriages (perhaps over to the Turkish bath).
  

      John Harvey Kellogg championed passive exercise, which was as relaxing as it sounds. He invented vibrating machines to move the body while the user remained largely still, allowing the machine to move his limbs or jiggle his fat away. Twenty minutes of vibration could stimulate the body as much as a 4-mile walk, Kellogg promised. By the 1950s, newspapers were writing about weight-loss salons, noting that their “passive exercise” provided a workout that approximated 36 holes of golf. One such salon, Slenderella, called “diet” a taboo word.

      Today, our 21st century obesity medications  might seem like magic bullets. But in reality, for some, weight loss on these drugs may be more modest than spectacular.  Plateaus are common and can be discouraging. If the dieter stops their weekly injectable, the weight often comes right back.
  

      It’s costly, it’s uncomfortable, and it can result in side effects: a grab bag of GI issues, some as serious as stomach paralysis or bowel obstruction. When considered in this context, semaglutide isn’t the weight loss panacea it may appear to be.
  

      And even if taking semaglutide were just as hard as diet and exercise, diets are not a trial by fire to prove our modern mettle. Why do we praise hardship as heroic? There’s nothing noble about suffering through a diet, especially in the service of fickle beauty ideals and the pursuit of a slimmer body.
  

      Oprah and the millions of other Americans on prescription semaglutide and similar medications should be respected — or at least not ridiculed — for ignoring the insults and choosing what’s right for them, drug or no drug, diet or no diet."

      Although some may find it hard to believe (or wish it to be otherwise), King lived in a political climate and historical era not so different from our own. Civil rights activists were pilloried as anti-American subversives, Communist dupes and an unpatriotic mob, rhetoric echoed in contemporary attacks against Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters and even school teachers, whose classroom explorations of Black and American history have triggered a political backlash reminiscent of the civil rights era.
  

      Then, as now, racism, war, poverty and violence scarred the domestic landscape, and its parallel growth in the international arena threatened world peace and stability. Social justice movements swelled at home and abroad and anti-democratic forces organized strongholds in America that, although rooted in the Deep South’s former Confederacy, stretched from sea to shining sea. At the same time, the search for what King called the Beloved Community—a world free of the war’s pestilence, racism’s violence and poverty’s indignity—inspired social justice and peace activists in King’s time, just as ours.
  

      King’s political activism during 1963 reimagined American democracy on both an intimate and expansive scale, introducing a new lexicon for citizenship. He turned political debates over racial integration, non-violent civil disobedience and voting rights into a national, then global, referendum on freedom. King challenged a sitting president and attorney general, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, to recognize the moral urgency of the time by ending legalized racial segregation and guaranteeing Black voting rights.
  

      In our own time, contemporary activists (including but not limited to BLM) advocate for the abolition of racially biased systems of punishment, incarceration and policing. And, as their forerunners did, they continue to press for voting rights, equal education and environmental justice in communities of color – all a continuation of King’s legacy.

‘Rustin’ looks at civil rights icon




      What’s well-known about 1963 is King’s invitation of the entire nation, through his oratory at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, to join a mass movement with racial justice at its center. But it was the quieter moments in King’s year – his activism in Birmingham and his words from a prison cell – that made the march possible in the first place.
  

      Inspired by the righteous indignation of Black students and young people, King risked mistreatment in a Birmingham City Jail in order to convey the civil rights movement’s larger message of social transformation to the entire world. After White religious leaders in Birmingham implored King to slow down the scale of protests that triggered racial violence against peaceful demonstrators, King expressed his indignation through a letter that meditated on the roots of racial injustice.
  

      “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” King observed amidst this tumult in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”
  

      King blasted his era’s version of White “allies,” confessing to being, “gravely disappointed with the white moderate.” King challenged the moral equivalency of his day, which found White political and civic leaders at times castigating both the practitioners of Jim Crow segregation and the civil rights activists who protested against this unjust system.
  

      This kind of political handwringing is reflected in parts of today’s political climate, where White moderates hesitate to support voting rights, often misinterpret prison abolitionists as anti-police agitators and have failed to make a robust case for protecting the rights of educators to teach the fuller story about American history to school children.

Texas native Lyndon Johnson's southern roots helped John F. Kennedy carry the South and win the presidential election. As Senate majority leader, Johnson surprised everyone by accepting the VP position in 1962. To appease liberal Democrats, Kennedy's brother Robert Kennedy tried to talk the Texan out of the position, but Johnson refused, declaring, ""I want to be vice president, and, if the president will have me, I'll join him in making a fight for it."" After Kennedy's death, Johnson transitioned smoothly into his new role as leader of the nation. He went on to pass landmark civil rights legislation and was elected in his own right by a landslide.

Opinion: Three days in 1963 that are still changing America




      King wrote in 1963, “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s greatest stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the whote moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action….”
  

      These words stung in 1963, as they would today. By the late spring, on June 11, President John F. Kennedy joined King in affirming that the United States was undergoing a “revolution,” one that could either sow the seeds of future “discord” and destruction or inaugurate an experiment in multiracial democracy.
  

      “Those who do nothing invite shame as well as violence,” Kennedy explained to the nation during a televised national address that took place hours after the desegregation of the University of Alabama over the objections of segregationist governor George Wallace. “Those who act boldly recognize right was well as reality,” President Kennedy observed.
  

      Only months later, King explained at the March on Washington, “Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.”
  

      MLK Day 2024 reminds us that the partisan divisions of today are not so different from the political landscape faced by King in his time. The passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act were not pre-ordained - nor were they universally beloved pieces of legislation. They were controversial and hotly debated, and punctuated a decade of uprisings that conservatives decried as riots, activist regarded as revolts and the government characterized as civil disturbances. King famously characterized riots as the “language of the unheard.”

      Less well known is his sharp criticism against political moderation from his Birmingham jail cell. Dr. King might find, in our current age of assaults against teaching Black History, of voter suppression and backlash against struggles for racial and economic justice, a depressingly familiar reminder of the challenges he faced over 60 years ago.
  

      However, King remained defiantly optimistic in the movement’s ability to bend history’s will toward a long-delayed recognition of Black citizenship and dignity. “We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom,” he wrote while sitting in jail.
  

      And he did not stop there, for King understood that some things were universal – if Blacks were recognized as American citizens with inherent human dignity, then histories of colonialism, economic racism, war, poverty and violence could be overcome. This belief remains more crucially resonant in our own time – however distant we may feel from King’s life, his legacy is everywhere around us.

         — 
    


      President Joe Biden has launched arguably the most consequential military attack of this administration, striking multiple Houthi targets in Yemen and widening the conflict in the Middle East — something his administration has tried to avoid since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.
  









A still from a video shows multiple explosions in Saada province, north of Sanaa, Yemen, on January 12, local time.

Oil prices rise as US-led strikes in Yemen raise fears of wider conflict




      So how did we get here? The immediate reason, of course, is that the Houthis have launched 27 attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea in the approaches to the Suez Canal, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, in nominal support of Hamas. (Not a great time to have had an initially incommunicado, and still-hospitalized, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who authorized the strikes in Yemen from his hospital bed on Thursday.)
  

      The Houthis, who were once a ragtag militia with the purely local aim of trying to overthrow the Yemen government, are now projecting Iranian power, not only in the Red Sea but across the region. In other words, just as Hezbollah in Lebanon, 1,500 miles to the north of Yemen, is effectively an arm of the Iranian government, so too now are the Houthis.
  

      The Houthis practice a form of Zaydi Shiism that is theologically distinct from the orthodox Shia clerics who run Iran, and while the Houthis have been sympathetic to Iran in the past, it is only in recent years that they have become close allies.
  

      Here is how that happened: In 2015, in what would turn out to be a spectacular act of strategic folly, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, then the Saudi minister of defense, launched a war in neighboring Yemen to prevent the rebel Houthis from taking over the country.

US attacks in Yemen sharpen Biden’s military and political dilemmas




      The Saudis used considerable airpower in Yemen, killing an estimated 24,000 people, including 9,000 civilians, and leveling schools and hospitals with US intelligence and support, causing what the United Nations at the time called “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” Sound familiar? It was particularly ironic then that the Saudi crown prince convened a conference of Arab leaders last November in Riyadh who issued public statements condemning Israel’s actions in Gaza. (Of course, a key difference in the conflicts is that the war  in Gaza was touched off by Hamas’ attack on Israel.)
  

      During the Saudi war in Yemen, Iran, which views Saudi Arabia as a critical regional enemy, supplied the Houthis with a steady supply of armed drones and advanced ballistic missiles, the same weapons that the Houthis are now deploying against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Those weapons have also been used to attack oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Saudi-allied United Arab Emirates, and, more recently, have targeted Israel as well.
  

      After more than seven years of war and not achieving its aim of halting the Houthis from controlling much of Yemen, the Saudis are now trying to negotiate a peace deal with the Houthis, so Saudi Arabia was not one of the named participants on Thursday night’s strikes on Houthi targets. Yet, Saudi Arabia is a key reason that the Houthis are now so closely allied to Iran and so well armed.

      In a richly ironic statement, Saudi Arabia expressed concern over the US-led strikes against the Houthi targets, saying, “While the Kingdom stresses the importance of maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea region, in which freedom of navigation is an international demand because it harms the interests of the entire world, it calls for restraint and avoiding escalation in light of the events the region is witnessing.”
  

      Let’s hope that the US-led strikes restore deterrence against the Houthis launching more strikes in the Red Sea. But already the regional conflict that the Biden administration was hoping to contain has spread to Yemen, to Israel’s northern border with Hezbollah and to Iraq, where a recent US strike on the leader of an Iranian-backed militia has amplified calls for the removal of all US troops that remain in Iraq."

      US climate envoy John Kerry plans to step down from his post by this spring, a source close to Kerry confirmed to CNN.
  

      Kerry is leaving the position after three years at the helm of US climate diplomacy under the Biden administration. The source close to Kerry said he will still attend the World Economic Forum in January and is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference in February.
  

      The 80-year-old former secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president led US negotiations at three international climate summits, the most recent of which was held in Dubai.
  

      Kerry specifically prioritized restarting international climate talks between the US and China, and was key in negotiating the November Sunnylands agreement, a wide-ranging climate agreement between the two countries before COP28.
  

Axios first reported Kerry was stepping down and intends to join the Biden campaign. CNN has reached out to the Biden campaign and the White House for comment.
  

      Before joining the Biden administration, Kerry had long worked on climate issues. As secretary of state, he played a key role in negotiating the Paris agreement, which was adopted by nearly 200 nations in 2015 and was aimed at addressing the negative impacts of climate change.
  

      And in 2019, Kerry co-founded a bipartisan initiative of world leaders and celebrities to combat the climate crisis called World War Zero.
  

      Kerry also served alongside Joe Biden in the Senate for decades. He was first elected to the Senate to represent Massachusetts in 1984 after serving as lieutenant governor of the state under Gov. Michael Dukakis.
  

      In 2004, Kerry won the Democratic nomination for president before losing the general election to incumbent President George W. Bush. In 2009, when Biden became vice president, Kerry took over his role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was nominated to serve as secretary of state by Barack Obama in 2012.
  

      Kerry also served in the Navy in Vietnam as a gunboat officer on the Mekong Delta and was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts."

         — 
    


      The federal judge overseeing the election subversion case against former President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, was the victim of a swatting call on her home late Sunday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
  

      The source told CNN that a male caller said he had shot his girlfriend and would kill himself. The address the caller provided on the call was federal Judge Tanya Chutkan’s. Swatting incidents are dangerous prank calls that are made to authorities to lure them to a location under the false pretense that a crime has been committed or is in progress.
  

      According to the DC Metropolitan Police Department, officers responded to a reported shooting on Sunday night, but when they arrived to the location, they determined there was none.
  

CNN reported in August that security for Chutkan was increased in the days after Trump’s indictment in the election subversion case in DC and the judge was assigned the case.
  

      The federal election interference case is a result of special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all four counts. Chutkan scheduled the trial to begin on March 4, the day before voters in more than a dozen states will cast their primary ballots.
  

      Chutkan has faced threats before, including from a Texas woman arrested last summer and charged with threatening in a voicemail to kill the judge if Trump doesn’t get elected in 2024.
  

      Sunday’s incident marks the latest swatting call on a government official. Late last month, police responded to a swatting call at the home of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a day after she removed Trump from the state’s 2024 primary ballot. Also last month, Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott’s Naples home was swatted, and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s home in Rome, Georgia, was swatted on Christmas Day, officials said."

      When George Washington died in 1799, Congress tasked his Revolutionary War comrade Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee with composing a eulogy.
  

      “First in war — first in peace — and first in the hearts of his countrymen,” Lee wrote of Washington. The first president was “pious, just, humane, temperate and sincere; uniform, dignified and commanding.”
  

      Yet as president, even the saintly Washington wasn’t immune to criticism, and any idea that Americans would warmly venerate their leaders vanished with his successor, President John Adams. One newspaper editor, who the administration would later arrest, called Adams “old, querulous, bald, blind, crippled, toothless.”
  

      As we head into the first-in-the-nation voting in the 2024 primary this month, none of the presidential candidates is first in the hearts of their countrymen. Joe Biden is 81, the oldest president ever and one who is struggling with John Adams-level unpopularity.

      Former President Donald Trump is also deeply disliked by a majority of American voters and suffers the added liability of being the first former president to be criminally indicted (four times). Colorado’s top court ordered Trump’s name to be taken off the ballot for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election and Maine’s secretary of state followed suit, but other states have rejected similar arguments. On Friday afternoon the US Supreme Court announced it would hear arguments on the case February 8.
  

      It places the nine justices at the center of a presidential election for the first time since the court’s pivotal ruling that stopped the recounting of the votes in Florida in 2000, handing the presidency to George W. Bush.
  

      On Friday near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where Washington hunkered down for the 1777-1778 winter with an ailing and battle-bruised Continental Army, Biden sought to cast Trump’s campaign as an existential threat to American democracy. Trump responded by accusing Biden of “pathetic fearmongering.”
  

      It’s been three years since Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6. Harry Dunn, who served in the Capitol Police for 15 years, was one of those guarding the symbol of American democracy that day.
  

      “Those who took part in the assault against the Capitol used all kinds of weapons against the officers defending it: Flagpoles were used as pikes. Metal bike racks that they had torn apart became bludgeons,” Dunn wrote. “Some of the police officers who fought alongside me were screaming in pain from the injuries they suffered while battling the attackers. Many officers were temporarily blinded and coughing from chemical irritants being sprayed in their faces. Police officers like myself who were Black were verbally assaulted with racial epithets, in addition to the physical blows we endured.”
  

      “Our scars, both physical and emotional, still run deep and serve as a constant reminder of the fragility of our democratic institutions.” Dunn announced this week that he is running for a House seat representing a Maryland district.
  

    Biden and the border


      As SE Cupp noted, Biden, with only 39% of voters satisfied with his job performance, has “the lowest approval rating of the last eight administrations at the same point in their presidencies.” Republicans are bashing him for the surge of migrants across the southern border.
  

      How should the president react? Close the border, Cupp argued. “It’s a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis and a crisis of national security. That is, in every way, the responsibility of the president to address … Closing the border will force Democrats and Republicans in Congress to the table, to get something done finally. Why? Democrats will want the border re-opened as soon as possible, and Republicans won’t want Biden to take away one of their biggest — and frankly best — talking points.”
  

    Up against Trump









Lisa Benson/Counterpoint Media



      This month’s first contests in the presidential primary — the Iowa caucus on Jan. 15 and New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23 — will test Trump’s so-far unshakable lead in the GOP race. Judging by the polls, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis could potentially upstage Trump, but they have a fair amount of ground to make up.
  

      In back-to-back CNN town halls Thursday, each made their case. “In need of a political Hail Mary, DeSantis executed as well as could be expected, but his performance seems unlikely to have sparked a fire,” wrote Patrick T. Brown. “Haley, on the other hand, can be content to play the long game, hoping her surprisingly good poll numbers in New Hampshire hold before the campaign trail turns south to her home state. Her performance Thursday night — offering fairly traditional GOP orthodoxy with a blend of compelling personal narrative and present-yet-understated identity politics — may offer GOP voters who are seeking an alternative to Trump their most likely vehicle. The key question, one that Iowa will shed some light on come January 15, is how many of those voters actually exist.”

      The traditional “game changers” associated with Iowa and New Hampshire may instead result from Trump’s experiences in court this year, argued Julian Zelizer. “While the indictments and trials have done little to hurt Trump politically thus far, and in many ways, they seem to have boosted his standing by fueling the anti-establishment message and making it difficult for opponents to secure much airtime,” Zelizer wrote, “it is possible that a conviction would look very different.” (Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases brought against him.)
  

      If the economy is the determining factor in the election, Biden should have an edge, according to John Avlon. The US has more than made up for the jobs it lost during the pandemic, wages are increasing faster than prices and the economy is growing. “Look at the data and ask yourself whether Americans overall — and America itself — are better off now under Biden than at the end of the Trump presidency? The answer is yes.”

    Mideast powder keg


      A drone kills a Hamas leader in Beirut, Israel exchanges fire with Hezbollah across the Lebanese border, the Iran-backed Houthi militia attacks commercial shipping in the Red Sea, suicide bombings for which ISIS has claimed responsibility kill at least 84 people in Iran. Every day brings more signs of the violence and instability plaguing the Middle East, Peter Bergen pointed out.
  

      “This all makes for a simmering mess, because while armed drones and proxy forces allow powers like the US, Israel and Iran to avoid all-out conventional wars, reliance on drones and proxies is also playing with fire as they move all these powers closer to all-out conflict. The history of warfare, after all, suggests that it is the most uncertain of human enterprises, and seemingly relatively unimportant events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, which became a key trigger of World War I, can instigate broader conflicts,” wrote Bergen.
  

      In the midst of the Mideast conflict, there are questions about Israel’s leader. “Now that the war against Hamas has entered a new phase, with Israeli military officials announcing they will start withdrawing from Gaza several brigades in advance of lengthy, but apparently lower intensity, more targeted fighting,” wrote Frida Ghitis, “Israelis can turn their attention to the urgent matter of the prime minister who failed at his most important job: keeping the country safe.”
  

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “has also failed since October 7 in refusing to take responsibility for the disaster, repeatedly affirming, ‘We’re going to answer all these questions,’ about what went wrong. But now, ‘Let’s focus on victory.’”
  

      “The fact that Netanyahu expects the reckoning to come after the war creates an incentive for him to prolong it. As Israel decides how to pursue the conflict with Hamas going forward, that’s a conflict of interest that is unacceptable and dangerous.”
  

    Claudine Gay resigns









Bill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency



      The resignation of Harvard President Claudine Gay launched a flood of commentary, including her own opinion piece in the New York Times. To historian Jeremi Suri of the University of Texas at Austin, the controversy touched off by the December 5 congressional hearing featuring Gay and the presidents of two other Ivy League universities, yields lessons about the role of America’s higher education system, which he called “the envy of the world.”
  

      “Students and scholars from every continent make enormous personal sacrifices to gain admission to US campuses, and in recent years applications to the most prestigious schools have increased dramatically…” But America’s institutions of higher learning are increasingly struggling to tell their story within the US — and to retain the confidence of the public.
  

      “American universities offer dynamic spaces for learning and discovery, unparalleled by any other institution, and they promote efforts to improve the world in ways large and small,” Suri observed. “On most campuses today, that compelling mission does not have the defenders it deserves … Too often college presidents are chosen not to lead for a purpose, but to keep the most influential members of their communities comfortable. Like other politicians today, they serve interest groups,” with students and scholars often being the least influential.
  

      The congressional hearing featuring the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania “showed that they were uncomfortable with difficult moral issues, fearful of offending any vocal group and committed to quiescence over engaged discussion, including legitimate protests. By not taking a side or saying everything ‘depends on context,’ they pleased no one and antagonized everyone. That is not how educators, who thrive on the study of controversial issues, behave. It is how administrators are taught to act and keep their careers moving forward.”


    AI comes for content creators









Nick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency



      The New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft Corp., claiming their artificial intelligence models use the newspaper’s work without permission. As law professor Seán O’Connor wrote, the case raises a fundamental question:
  

      “When artificial intelligence firms set their systems to scrape and ingest millions of painstakingly produced news stories, is it comparable to art students learning to paint by recreating the “Mona Lisa” — or unfair misappropriation?”
  

      The defendants will likely argue that they’re just making “fair use” of the work, under copyright law. “Can a generative AI reproduction of previously published news and commentary be fair use? I don’t think so,” O’Connor observed. “Some journalists become more widely read than others not just because they publish first or have better insights but also because they express their ideas well … Generative AI’s use is not ‘transformative’ in that it is not commenting on or critiquing the original story or shifting it to a different medium, purpose or context. It is, instead, reproducing substantial parts of others’ work simply to compete in the same market channels as the original.”
  

      “Rather than mastering the styles of other experts to develop new and better ones, it is a snaking hose flailing around uncontrollably, spewing thoughtless sequences of text based solely on probabilities that one word comes after another in human expression.”

    ‘Your Fat Friend’


      Aubrey Gordon began her career writing under the pen name “Your Fat Friend.” As Sara Stewart noted, Gordon and filmmaker Jeanie Finlay have collaborated on a widely praised documentary with the same title.
  

      The name came from a letter Gordon sent to a friend explaining “how she, as a 350-pound woman, would like to be addressed.”
  

      “Just say fat,” Gordon reads from her essay in the film. “Not ‘curvy’ or ‘chubby’ or ‘chunky’ or ‘fluffy’ or ‘more to love’ or ‘big guy’ or ‘full-figured’ or ‘big-boned’ or ‘queen size’ or ‘husky’ or ‘obese’ or ‘overweight.’ Just say fat.”
  

      “As Gordon acknowledges, many thin people (whether they are medical professionals or strangers) presume they know better than a fat person what that person should and shouldn’t eat. Gordon recalls one woman removing a melon from her grocery cart, telling her it has too much sugar. ‘It’s a melon!’ Gordon exclaims incredulously to the camera,” Stewart noted.
  

      “But as she and other fat activists have publicly said for years now, it’s laughable to think they are unaware of nutrition and health recommendations, of the benefits of exercise and the dangers of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases. Listening to her describe a nonstop intrusion of strangers’ cutting remarks and disapproving looks and overheard comments from people desperate to lose five or 10 pounds — anything, Gordon points out, to avoid looking like her own body — is to begin to understand the severity of the damaging scrutiny to which fat people are subjected.”"

      Meet Retro, a cloned rhesus monkey born on July 16, 2020.
  

      He is now more than 3 years old and is “doing well and growing strong,” according to Falong Lu, one of the authors of a study published in the journal Nature Communications Tuesday that describes how Retro came to be.
  

      Retro is only the second species of primate that scientists have been able to clone successfully. The same team of researchers announced in 2018 that they had made two identical cloned cynomolgus monkeys (a type of macaque), which are still alive today.
  

      “We have achieved the first live and healthy cloned rhesus monkey, which is a big step forward that has turned impossible to possible, although the efficiency is very low compared to normal fertilized embryos,” said Lu, an investigator at the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology and Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. “Currently, we haven’t had the second live birth yet.”

Scientists create chimeric monkey with two sets of DNA




      The first mammal to be cloned — Dolly the sheep — was created in 1996 using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, where scientists essentially reconstruct an unfertilized egg by fusing a somatic cell nucleus (not from a sperm or egg) with an egg in which the nucleus has been removed.
  

      Since then, scientists have cloned many mammalian species, including pigs, cows, horses and dogs, but the process has been hit or miss, with typically only a tiny percentage of the embryos that are transferred into surrogates resulting in viable offspring.
  

      “In a way we have made much progress in that, after Dolly, many mammalian species were cloned, but the truth is that inefficiency remains a major roadblock,” said Miguel Esteban, principal investigator with the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was not involved in the latest research but has collaborated with some members of the research team on other primate studies.
  

    Cloning a rhesus monkey


      The Chinese team, based in Shanghai and Beijing, used a modified version of SCNT in their work on cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and tweaked the technique further to clone the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).
  

      During hundreds of failed cloning attempts, they realized that, in the early cloned embryos, the outer membrane that forms the placenta did not develop properly. To address this problem, they performed a process called inner cell mass transplantation, which involved putting cloned inner cells into a non-cloned embryo, and that allowed the clone to develop normally, Esteban explained.

Scientists create mice from two dads after making eggs from skin cells




      The team then tested the new technique using 113 reconstructed embryos, 11 of which were transferred to seven surrogates, resulting in only one live birth, according to the study.
  

      “We think that there might be additional…. abnormalities to be fixed. Strategies to further enhance the success rate of SCNT in primates remains …our main focus in the future,” Lu said
  

      The first two cloned monkeys, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, are now more than 6 years old and live a “happy and healthy life” with others of the same species. Lu said thus far the researchers have not identified any potential limits on the cloned monkeys’ lifespan.
  

      Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are usually described as the first cloned monkeys. However, a rhesus monkey was cloned in 1999 using what researchers consider a simpler cloning method. In that case, scientists split the embryos, much like what happens naturally when identical twins develop, rather than using an adult cell like with the SCNT technique.
  

     The implications of cloning monkeys


      The researchers said that being able to successfully clone monkeys might help accelerate biomedical research given that there are limitations on what scientists can learn from lab mice. Research on nonhuman primates, which are closer to humans, has been pivotal to lifesaving medical advances, including the creation of vaccines against Covid-19, according to a report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released in May.
  

      The use of monkeys in scientific research is a contentious issue because of ethical concerns about animal welfare. The team said it followed Chinese laws and guidelines governing the use of nonhuman primates in scientific research.
  

      The UK’s Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it has “serious ethical and welfare concerns around the application of cloning technology to animals. Cloning animals requires procedures that can cause pain and distress, and there can be high failure and mortality rates.”
  

      Being able to produce genetically identical monkeys could be useful, Esteban said.
  

      “This research is proof of principle that cloning can be done in different non-human primate species and opens the door to new ways of enhancing the efficiency. Cloned monkeys can be genetically engineered in complex ways that wild-type monkeys cannot; this has many implications for disease modeling. There is also a species conservation perspective,” he added.
  

      Dr Lluís Montoliu, research scientist at the National Center for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC) in Spain who wasn’t involved in the research, said that cloning both species of monkey demonstrated two things.
  

      “First, it is possible to clone primates. And second, no less important, it is extremely difficult to succeed with these experiments, with such low efficiencies,” he said in a statement.
  

      He added that the low success rate of the process showed that “not only was human cloning unnecessary and debatable, but if attempted, it would be extraordinarily difficult and ethically unjustifiable.”
  

      “Reproductive cloning a human being is completely unacceptable,” Lu said."

      The Chinese team, based in Shanghai and Beijing, used a modified version of SCNT in their work on cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and tweaked the technique further to clone the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).
  

      During hundreds of failed cloning attempts, they realized that, in the early cloned embryos, the outer membrane that forms the placenta did not develop properly. To address this problem, they performed a process called inner cell mass transplantation, which involved putting cloned inner cells into a non-cloned embryo, and that allowed the clone to develop normally, Esteban explained.

      The team then tested the new technique using 113 reconstructed embryos, 11 of which were transferred to seven surrogates, resulting in only one live birth, according to the study.
  

      “We think that there might be additional…. abnormalities to be fixed. Strategies to further enhance the success rate of SCNT in primates remains …our main focus in the future,” Lu said
  

      The first two cloned monkeys, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, are now more than 6 years old and live a “happy and healthy life” with others of the same species. Lu said thus far the researchers have not identified any potential limits on the cloned monkeys’ lifespan.
  

      Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are usually described as the first cloned monkeys. However, a rhesus monkey was cloned in 1999 using what researchers consider a simpler cloning method. In that case, scientists split the embryos, much like what happens naturally when identical twins develop, rather than using an adult cell like with the SCNT technique.
  

     The implications of cloning monkeys


      The researchers said that being able to successfully clone monkeys might help accelerate biomedical research given that there are limitations on what scientists can learn from lab mice. Research on nonhuman primates, which are closer to humans, has been pivotal to lifesaving medical advances, including the creation of vaccines against Covid-19, according to a report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released in May.
  

      The use of monkeys in scientific research is a contentious issue because of ethical concerns about animal welfare. The team said it followed Chinese laws and guidelines governing the use of nonhuman primates in scientific research.
  

      The UK’s Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it has “serious ethical and welfare concerns around the application of cloning technology to animals. Cloning animals requires procedures that can cause pain and distress, and there can be high failure and mortality rates.”
  

      Being able to produce genetically identical monkeys could be useful, Esteban said.
  

      “This research is proof of principle that cloning can be done in different non-human primate species and opens the door to new ways of enhancing the efficiency. Cloned monkeys can be genetically engineered in complex ways that wild-type monkeys cannot; this has many implications for disease modeling. There is also a species conservation perspective,” he added.
  

      Dr Lluís Montoliu, research scientist at the National Center for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC) in Spain who wasn’t involved in the research, said that cloning both species of monkey demonstrated two things.
  

      “First, it is possible to clone primates. And second, no less important, it is extremely difficult to succeed with these experiments, with such low efficiencies,” he said in a statement.
  

      He added that the low success rate of the process showed that “not only was human cloning unnecessary and debatable, but if attempted, it would be extraordinarily difficult and ethically unjustifiable.”
  

      “Reproductive cloning a human being is completely unacceptable,” Lu said."

         — 
    


      The Peregrine spacecraft — which launched last week on the first US mission to aim for a moon landing in over 50 years — is headed back toward Earth and expected to make a fiery reentry after a critical fuel leak dashed its lunar ambitions.
  

      The failed moon landing attempt is a setback for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program, which recruits private companies to help the space agency investigate the lunar surface as it aims to return humans to the moon later this decade.
  

      Astrobotic Technology, the company that developed the Peregrine lander under a $108 million contract with NASA, revealed Sunday that it made the decision to dispose of the spacecraft by allowing it to disintegrate midair while plunging back toward Earth.

The moon has entered a new epoch, scientists say




      “While we believe it is possible for the spacecraft to operate for several more weeks and could potentially have raised the orbit to miss the Earth, we must take into consideration the anomalous state of the propulsion system and utilize the vehicle’s onboard capability to end the mission responsibly and safely,” according to an update posted to the Pittsburgh-based company’s website. “We do not believe Peregrine’s re-entry poses safety risks, and the spacecraft will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.”
  

      The Peregrine vehicle’s impending demise comes after the spacecraft faced challenges while en route to the moon, including an “anomaly” that resulted in its solar-powered battery pointing away from the sun and the fuel leak that left the spacecraft without enough propellant to complete its planned mission to gently touch down on the lunar surface.
  

      It’s not yet clear what caused the leak.
  

      Astrobotic and NASA are expected to give further updates on the mission during a news conference at 12 p.m. ET on Thursday.
  

      “It is a great honor to witness firsthand the heroic efforts of our mission control team overcoming enormous challenges to recover and operate the spacecraft,” said Astrobotic CEO John Thornton in a Sunday statement. “I look forward to sharing these, and more remarkable stories, after the mission concludes on January 18. This mission has already taught us so much and has given me great confidence that our next mission to the Moon will achieve a soft landing.”
  

    Weighing disposal options


      Astrobotic did have other options for disposing of the Peregrine lander.
  

      The spacecraft could have been left to the cosmos, destined to spend eternity in the dark expanse. But the company said it decided against that route considering the “risk that our damaged spacecraft could cause a problem.” The Peregrine lander would essentially become a piece of uncontrolled garbage, capable of smashing into other objects in space, such as operational satellites.
  

      The company may have also considered allowing the Peregrine vehicle to crash-land on the moon, as many spacecraft have done — intentionally and unintentionally — on lunar missions of years past.
  

      When it returns to Earth, the vehicle will be obliterated as it smashes into the planet’s thick atmosphere at high speeds. The company said its decision to bring Peregrine back came after receiving “inputs from the space community and the U.S. Government on the most safe and responsible course of action.”
  

    Critical errors


      If Peregrine had reached the moon, it might have become the first US spacecraft to land on the lunar surface since NASA’s Apollo 17 mission in 1972.
  

      But the company acknowledged just hours after its spacecraft launched on January 8 that a soft landing on the moon would not be possible.
  

      Astrobotic then switched course — aiming to operate the vehicle as a satellite as its tanks were drained.
  

      Peregrine’s fuel leak slowed in the days following its launch, leaving the spacecraft with the ability to limp along for thousands of miles.

Peregrine mission abandons moon landing attempt after suffering ‘critical’ fuel loss




      For the vast majority of the mission, the Peregrine lander has been controlled solely by its attitude control thrusters, which are tiny engines mounted to the side of the lander and designed to maintain stability or make precision movements.
  

      At one point, the company said it was able to briefly power on one of the spacecraft’s main engines, which are designed to give up to three bursts of power to push the Peregrine lander farther out toward the moon after reaching space.
  

      But — because of the fuel leak — long, controlled burns of the main engines were impossible, Astrobotic said.
  

      As of Monday, the company said the spacecraft was about 218,000 miles (351,000 kilometers) from Earth.
  

    What Peregrine could and couldn’t accomplish


      Astrobotic was able to power on some of the science instruments and other payloads on board the lander.
  

      Two of NASA’s five payloads — the Neutron Spectrometer System and the Linear Energy Transfer Spectrometer — were able to gather data on radiation levels in space, the space agency announced in a January 11 news release. While NASA had hoped to take those measurements on the lunar surface — where it’s planning to return astronauts later this decade — space agency officials indicated the data was still valuable.
  

      The Peregrine lander was also able to activate a new sensor, developed by NASA, that was designed to help the spacecraft land on the moon. Called the Navigation Doppler Lidar, it uses lasers and the Doppler effect — which employs wave frequency to measure distance — to make precision navigations.
  

      “Measurements and operations of the NASA-provided science instruments on board will provide valuable experience, technical knowledge, and scientific data to future CLPS lunar deliveries,” said Joel Kearns, the deputy associate administrator for exploration with NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement.

      But at least one of NASA’s science instruments — the Laser Retroreflector Array — was not able to function. The LRA is a collection of eight prisms embedded in aluminum that can reflect lasers and relay precise locations. NASA engineers designed the array to become a permanent feature on the moon, helping other spacecraft orient their locations.
  

      Likewise, an array of other payloads designed specifically to operate on the moon remain trapped aboard the Peregrine lander. They include a rover developed at Carnegie Mellon University and five tiny robots from the Mexican Space Agency that were designed to be catapulted onto the lunar surface.
  

      The Peregrine spacecraft is also carrying various mementos, letters and even human remains that customers paid to fly on the mission."

How to exercise from the comfort of your couch




      Strength training, whether performed with weights, bands, machines or your own body weight, is important for your long-term health. Also known as resistance training, it increases muscular strength, endurance and bone density. These exercises also decreases the risk of falls and fractures as you age, thus promoting independent living, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s why the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults do muscle-strengthening activities two or more days per week, working all major muscle groups at a moderate or greater intensity.
  

      Unfortunately, a mere 30.2% of Americans meet these guidelines, according to a 2017 data analysis published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. In the same study, nearly 60% of participants said they did no strength training at all.

      Resistance training also varies by locale, according to a 2020 analysis of National Health Interview Survey data. Specifically, those living in larger metropolitan areas and in the West US Census Bureau region were more likely to meet the CDC’s physical activity guidelines than those in less populated areas and other regions.
  

      All of this is unfortunate, as resistance training is far more important than most people realize, said Dr. Tommy Lundberg, an exercise researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and author of “The Physiology of Resistance Training,” published in October.
  






Exercise researcher Dr. Tommy Lundberg, author of “The Physiology of Resistance Training,” says strength training is most important for people older than age 65.

      Lundberg shares his thoughts on why we shouldn’t overlook this important component of healthy living.
  

This conversation was edited and condensed for clarity.


CNN: Why is strength training important for good health?


Dr. Tommy Lundberg: You get improved blood glucose control, especially if you have type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. You feel better — which is a very important effect, as it can reduce stress levels — and you typically get better sleep. As you age, it helps you function better so you can carry out your daily activities for a longer period of time. It also helps reduce your risk of falls.
  

CNN: Does resistance training help prevent any diseases or chronic conditions?


Lundberg: Data suggests you may have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases by strength training. But we sometimes overestimate the effects of exercise and strength training on things like life span and cardiovascular disease risk. That’s why I prefer to mainly talk about strength training’s short-term effects, because you can bet your money on those.


CNN: Does any demographic benefit the most from strength training?

What’s more important as you age — stretching, balance work or strength training?




Lundberg: I recommend both aerobic and resistance training for all ages, but it’s fair to make a case that strength training is most important for people over 65. That’s because of the link between strength training and better physical function, reduced falls and improved balance.
  

      We know that sarcopenia — which is the loss of muscle strength and function that starts to develop when we’re older — especially accelerates after 70 and 80 years of age. Resistance training is the only means to effectively maintain or even increase your muscle mass. There is no drug available today, or any diet that we can adopt, to get the benefits that we can get from strength training.
  

CNN: Has the need for strength training always been an issue for humans?


Lundberg: There is some data indicating that a large portion of society is more sedentary today compared with the past. But life span is also increasing, and it’s estimated to continue to increase in the coming decades. So we will have a growing population of older people who will need to strengthen their muscles to be able to carry out their daily activities and remain independent, but also to reduce the burden on our health care system.
  






No one type of equipment is necessarily better than another when it comes to strength training, says Lundberg, adding it depends on the goals and person.

CNN: Is strength training also important for optimal sports performance?


Lundberg: Strength training is an integral part of many sports, because there are countless sports where you need to jump high or move fast or produce high forces (such as when sprinting or dunking a basketball), which strength training can help with.
  

      There is also evidence to suggest it can reduce your injury risk. For example, in soccer, which I play, there is strong evidence that it reduces your risk of a hamstring muscle injury, which is the most common injury in soccer.

Strength training with free weights: How to reboot your workout routine




CNN: Which do you think is best — strength training using your body weight, free weights, gym equipment or bands?


Lundberg: There’s nothing that strongly suggests one type of equipment is much better than another. It depends on the goals and the person.
  

CNN: Can you suggest a strength-training regimen for the average person?Lundberg: The general recommendation is to do muscle-strengthening activities two times per week, including all of the large muscle groups. If you want to be time effective, do one or two sets of each exercise. If you have more time, do three or four. But it’s always better to reduce the number of sets per exercise than to reduce the number of exercises.
  

      The effort level is also quite important. You should exercise until you feel a small burning sensation and come close to the point where you can’t do another repetition. You don’t need to reach failure necessarily, but do repetitions until you feel that, OK, this is becoming quite heavy now.

Sitting too much is bad for your health, but offsetting the impact is easy, study shows




CNN: What’s your weekly routine?


Lundberg: I don’t have time for long sessions, so I do frequent, very short sessions — often 10, 15 minutes of exercise. That could be a 1K run, it could be three sets of three different exercises, like jumps, push-ups, sit-ups or squats. You can get good health effects, and even good training results, with short sessions. But you do need a relatively high intensity, and you do need to do it frequently, like a few times a week.
  

CNN: What else is important to know on this topic?


Lundberg: It’s not enough to advocate for exercise. We won’t reach those who are the most sedentary. We need to build physical activity and exercise into the environment. We need to have green areas, we need to have more outdoor gyms, maybe more physical activity in school. It has to be easier to take the stairs instead of the escalator. That perspective is important if you really want to change public health.

      For thousands of years, the moon inspired humans from afar, but the bright beacon in Earth’s night sky — located more than 200,000 miles (321,868 kilometers) away — remained out of reach. That all changed on September 13, 1959, when the former Soviet Union’s uncrewed spacecraft, Luna 2, landed on the moon’s surface.
  

      The Luna 2 probe created a crater when it touched down on the moon between the lunar regions of Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis, according to NASA.
  

      That pivotal, lunar dust-stirring moment signaled the beginning of humanity’s endeavors to explore the moon, and some scientists now suggest it was also the start of a new geological epoch — or period of time in history — called the “Lunar Anthropocene,” according to a comment paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience on December 8.

SpaceX’s explosive test flight achieved key milestones. But there is still a long way to go




      “The idea is much the same as the discussion of the Anthropocene on Earth — the exploration of how much humans have impacted our planet,” said the paper’s lead author Justin Holcomb, a postdoctoral researcher with the Kansas Geological Survey at the University of Kansas, in a statement.
  

      “The consensus is on Earth the Anthropocene began at some point in the past, whether hundreds of thousands of years ago or in the 1950s,” Holcomb said. “Similarly, on the moon, we argue the Lunar Anthropocene already has commenced, but we want to prevent massive damage or a delay of its recognition until we can measure a significant lunar halo caused by human activities, which would be too late.”
  

      Scientists have tried for years to declare a definitive Anthropocene on Earth, and recently presented new evidence of a site in Canada that some researchers believe marks the start of the transformative chapter in our planet’s history.
  

      The idea of the Lunar Anthropocene arrives at a time when civil space agencies and commercial entities are showing a renewed interest in returning to the moon, or for some, landing on it for the first time.
  

      And the paper’s authors argue that the moon’s environment, already shaped by humans during the beginning of the Lunar Anthropocene, will be altered in more drastic ways as exploration increases.
  

    Humanity’s lunar footprint


      Outdoor enthusiasts and visitors to national parks are likely familiar with the concept of “Leave No Trace” — respecting and maintaining natural environments, leaving things the way they were found and properly disposing of waste.
  

      The moon, however, is littered with the traces of exploration.
  

      Since Luna 2’s landing, more than a hundred spacecraft have crashed and made soft landings on the moon and “humans have caused surface disturbances in at least 58 additional locations on the lunar surface,” according to the paper. Touching down on the lunar surface is incredibly difficult, as evidenced by numerous crashes that have made their mark and created new craters.
  






Humanity has left its mark on the moon in many ways, including impact craters left by spacecraft, lunar rover tracks, astronaut bootprints, science experiments and even family photos brought by astronauts.

      The Cold War space race kicked off a series of lunar missions, and the majority since then have been uncrewed. NASA’s Apollo missions were the first to send humans around the moon during the 1960s before safely landing astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time in 1969 with Apollo 11. Ultimately, 12 NASA astronauts walked on the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972.
  

      With the arrival of humans came a plethora of objects that have been left behind, including scientific equipment for experiments, spacecraft components, flags, photographs, and even golf balls, bags of human excrement and religious texts, according to the paper.
  

      From Earth, the moon appears unchanged. After all, it doesn’t have a protective atmosphere or magnetosphere like our life-sustaining world does. Micrometeorites regularly hit the surface because the moon has no way of shielding itself from space rocks.
  

      Declaring a Lunar Anthropocene could make it clear that the moon is changing in ways it wouldn’t naturally due to human exploration, the researchers said.

      “Cultural processes are starting to outstrip the natural background of geological processes on the moon,” Holcomb said. “These processes involve moving sediments, which we refer to as ‘regolith,’ on the moon. Typically, these processes include meteoroid impacts and mass movement events, among others. However, when we consider the impact of rovers, landers and human movement, they significantly disturb the regolith.”
  

      The moon also has features like a delicate exosphere composed of dust and gas and ice inside permanently shadowed areas that are vulnerable and could be disturbed by continued explorations, the authors wrote in their paper. “Future missions must consider mitigating deleterious effects on lunar environments.”
  

    Lunar exploration frenzy


      A new space race is heating up as multiple countries set their sights on landing both robotic and crewed missions to explore the moon’s south pole and other unexplored and difficult-to-reach lunar regions.
  

      India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission made a historic successful landing on the moon in 2023 after Russia’s Luna 25 spacecraft and Japanese company Ispace’s ‎HAKUTO-R lander both crashed. This year, multiple missions are heading for the moon, including Japan’s “Moon Sniper” lander that is expected to attempt to touch down on January 19.
  

      Astrobotic Technology’s Peregrine spacecraft launched this week amid objections by the Navajo Nation that the vehicle carried human remains that customers paid to send to the lunar surface, sparking fresh debate over who controls the moon. But a propulsion issue noticed hours after liftoff means that Peregrine won’t be able to attempt a moon landing, and currently, its fate is uncertain.
  

      NASA’s Artemis program intends to return humans to the lunar surface in 2026. The agency’s ambitions include establishing a sustained human presence on the moon, with habitats that are supported by resources like water ice at the lunar south pole. China’s space ambitions also include landing on the moon.
  

      “In the context of the new space race, the lunar landscape will be entirely different in 50 years,” Holcomb said. “Multiple countries will be present, leading to numerous challenges. Our goal is to dispel the lunar-static myth and emphasize the importance of our impact, not only in the past but ongoing and in the future. We aim to initiate discussions about our impact on the lunar surface before it’s too late.”
  

    The moon’s archaeological record


      Humanity’s traces on the moon have come to be viewed as artifacts that essentially need some form of protection. Researchers have long expressed a desire to maintain the Apollo landing sites and catalog the items left behind to preserve “space heritage.” But this type of preservation is difficult to pull off because no one country or entity “owns” the  moon.
  

      “A recurring theme in our work is the significance of lunar material and footprints on the moon as valuable resources, akin to an archaeological record that we’re committed to preserving,” Holcomb said. “The concept of a Lunar Anthropocene aims to raise awareness and contemplation regarding our impact on the lunar surface, as well as our influence on the preservation of historical artifacts.”

      The Apollo 11 lunar landing marked the first time humans set foot on another world. The footprints left in the lunar dust by astronauts are perhaps the most emblematic of humanity’s ongoing journey, which will likely include planets like Mars in the future, the researchers said.
  

      “As archaeologists, we perceive footprints on the moon as an extension of humanity’s journey out of Africa, a pivotal milestone in our species’ existence,” Holcomb said. “These imprints are intertwined with the overarching narrative of evolution. It’s within this framework we seek to capture the interest of not only planetary scientists but also archaeologists and anthropologists who may not typically engage in discussions about planetary science.”"

         — 
    


      A volcano erupted in southwest Iceland, sending molten lava into a nearby town and setting houses ablaze, authorities say, in the second eruption the area has seen in weeks.
  

      There was no immediate threat to the residents of Grindavik, a small fishing town, which is under evacuation orders.
  

      A webcam set up by Iceland’s public broadcaster RUV showed a stream of lava flowing into Grindavík, with the burning buildings just meters away from other houses.
  

      Hjordis Gudmundsdottir, a spokesperson for Iceland’s Civil Protection Agency had warned CNN earlier that it was “quite possible” for lava to reach the town and damage infrastructure even as it was protected by anti-lava walls, and that authorities were tracking the flow.
  

      On Saturday, Iceland’s National Commissioner of Police ordered residents in Grindavík, first evacuated in November, to evacuate again by Monday night after volcanic fissures opened on roads in the area.
  

      Sixty households - 10% of the town’s usual population - have been evacuated so far, Gudmundsdottir said, adding that many people had not yet returned after last month’s eruption. There was no danger to human life, Gudmundsdottir said.

      Following the eruption, police raised the alert level. An Icelandic Coast Guard helicopter has also been deployed to monitor the situation.
  

      Hours before the eruption, Iceland’s meteorological office had reported an earthquake.
  

      Talking about air travel, Gudmundsdottir told CNN that the airport in nearby Keflavik was safe as the eruption hadn’t produced any ash, which can impact flights. “This eruption will not affect Keflavik airport or air travel in general,” she said.
  

      Grindavík, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Iceland’s capital city Reykjavík on the Reykjanes peninsula, was previously evacuated following weeks of seismic activity which culminated in a dramatic volcanic eruption that expelled bursts of lava and sent huge plumes of smoke into the sky.

      The crack after December’s eruption measured around four kilometers, while Sunday’s eruption crack was around a quarter of the length.
  

      The town is also home to Iceland’s famed Blue Lagoon, which draws tourists to its steaming geothermal water and is one of the country’s most visited attractions.

      “It can be assumed that the order will be in effect for the upcoming three weeks,” the country’s Civil Protection Agency said in a statement, adding that the only exceptions to the order would be for authorities to conduct official business or for residents “for short periods while salvaging valuables.”
  

      The latest evacuation order comes after the Icelandic Meteorological Office reported on Friday that hazards associated with volcanic fissures were deemed higher risk than in its previous assessment.
  

      “Based on the Civil Protection Department’s hazard assessment issued on January 12, it is not considered justifiable to continue to dwell in Grindavík, in light of public safety considerations,” the government agency said.

      The amount of magma had reached a level similar to when a previous eruption occurred in December, the agency said. But in the case of the latest eruption, magma could “migrate further south” – as compared to the previous eruption – and possibly reach Grindavík town.
  

      The eruption in December is thought to have been the largest so far, according to authorities

      As such, the country is accustomed to volcanic eruptions, though they often occur in the wilderness, away from populated areas.
  

      The Bárðarbunga volcanic system in the center of the country erupted in 2014, producing lava that covered 84 square kilometers (32 square miles) of highland but didn’t damage any communities.
  

      Experts do not expect the latest series of eruptions to cause the same level of chaos as seen in 2010 when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted, since it is unlikely to involve glacial ice that led to a huge ash cloud.
  

      About 100,000 flights were canceled, affecting 2 million people, as a result of the ash spewed out by the 2010 eruption, which threatened to stall aircraft engines and cause electrical failure."

      A volcano erupted in southwest Iceland, sending molten lava into a nearby town and setting houses ablaze, authorities say, in the second eruption the area has seen in weeks.
  

      There was no immediate threat to the residents of Grindavik, a small fishing town, which is under evacuation orders.
  

      A webcam set up by Iceland’s public broadcaster RUV showed a stream of lava flowing into Grindavík, with the burning buildings just meters away from other houses.
  

      Hjordis Gudmundsdottir, a spokesperson for Iceland’s Civil Protection Agency had warned CNN earlier that it was “quite possible” for lava to reach the town and damage infrastructure even as it was protected by anti-lava walls, and that authorities were tracking the flow.
  

      On Saturday, Iceland’s National Commissioner of Police ordered residents in Grindavík, first evacuated in November, to evacuate again by Monday night after volcanic fissures opened on roads in the area.
  

      Sixty households - 10% of the town’s usual population - have been evacuated so far, Gudmundsdottir said, adding that many people had not yet returned after last month’s eruption. There was no danger to human life, Gudmundsdottir said.

      Following the eruption, police raised the alert level. An Icelandic Coast Guard helicopter has also been deployed to monitor the situation.
  

      Hours before the eruption, Iceland’s meteorological office had reported an earthquake.
  

      Talking about air travel, Gudmundsdottir told CNN that the airport in nearby Keflavik was safe as the eruption hadn’t produced any ash, which can impact flights. “This eruption will not affect Keflavik airport or air travel in general,” she said.
  

      Grindavík, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Iceland’s capital city Reykjavík on the Reykjanes peninsula, was previously evacuated following weeks of seismic activity which culminated in a dramatic volcanic eruption that expelled bursts of lava and sent huge plumes of smoke into the sky.

      The crack after December’s eruption measured around four kilometers, while Sunday’s eruption crack was around a quarter of the length.
  

      The town is also home to Iceland’s famed Blue Lagoon, which draws tourists to its steaming geothermal water and is one of the country’s most visited attractions.

      “It can be assumed that the order will be in effect for the upcoming three weeks,” the country’s Civil Protection Agency said in a statement, adding that the only exceptions to the order would be for authorities to conduct official business or for residents “for short periods while salvaging valuables.”
  

      The latest evacuation order comes after the Icelandic Meteorological Office reported on Friday that hazards associated with volcanic fissures were deemed higher risk than in its previous assessment.
  

      “Based on the Civil Protection Department’s hazard assessment issued on January 12, it is not considered justifiable to continue to dwell in Grindavík, in light of public safety considerations,” the government agency said.

      The amount of magma had reached a level similar to when a previous eruption occurred in December, the agency said. But in the case of the latest eruption, magma could “migrate further south” – as compared to the previous eruption – and possibly reach Grindavík town.
  

      The eruption in December is thought to have been the largest so far, according to authorities

      Six people were arrested Sunday over a suspected plot to disrupt the London Stock Exchange (LSE) when the market opened for trade Monday, London’s Metropolitan Police has said.
  

      Detectives began an investigation after information was passed to the Metropolitan Police by the Daily Express newspaper Friday.
  

      It was alleged that activists from the Palestine Action group intended to target the exchange on Monday morning to cause damage and prevent it from “opening for trading,” according to a statement from the police force.
  

      The LSE hasn’t had a physical trading floor since 1986, with all equities trading taking place electronically. UK markets were functioning as normal Monday. 


      Palestine Action is a British-based activist group that aims to disrupt the operations of weapons manufacturers supplying the Israeli government.
  

      The group said in a post on X Sunday that the LSE raised “billions of pounds for the apartheid state of Israel” and “actively” boasted about its support for Israeli businesses.
  

      Metropolitan Police officers, working alongside colleagues from Merseyside Police in Liverpool, arrested six people Sunday on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage, the London force said, adding that all six remained in custody.
  

      According to a post on X from Palestine Action Monday, five of the six arrested activists have been released, while one has been charged with an offense and is shortly due to appear in court.
  

      Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Sian Thomas said: “These are significant arrests. We believe this group was ready to carry out a disruptive and damaging stunt which could have had serious implications had it been carried out successfully.”
  

      “I’m grateful to the Express for their willingness to provide the information gleaned from their own investigation. It was instrumental in helping us intervene successfully. Having only been provided with the material on Friday afternoon, we had limited time to act.” 


      The London Stock Exchange declined to comment on the matter."

         — 
    


      Millions of Catholic devotees flooded the streets of the Philippine capital Tuesday to honor the Black Nazarene, a centuries-old religious tradition that has returned after a three-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic.
  

      At least 6 million people jostled along the 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) route as the black wooden statue of Jesus Christ was carried from Quirino Grandstand to Quiapo Church in Manila, according to church officials.
  

      The procession started before dawn at around 4 a.m. and lasted 15 hours, church officials said.
  

      The turnout is comparable to pre-pandemic years but the longest procession on record was in 2012 when the Black Nazarene took 22 hours to arrive at the church.
  

      The Philippines is Asia’s largest Catholic-majority country. About 80% of its 110 million people identify as Roman Catholic, a legacy of more than 400 years under Spain’s former colonial rule.

      The procession pays homage to the statue, which many Filipinos believe has miraculous healing powers and that touching it, or the ropes attached to the main float, can bring blessings to them or their loved ones.
  

      It is also called the Traslacion, or “transfer,” referring to the relocation of the Black Nazarene to Quiapo Church.
  

      “I was super overwhelmed. Earlier, I didn’t know I shed a tear, maybe because of too much joy, too much excitement that the image of the Black Nazarene was let out for the Traslacion,” Rizza Batarina, 35, told CNN affiliate CNN Philippines.

      The Black Nazarene dates back to 1606, when the statue of Jesus kneeling on one knee arrived in the Philippines from Mexico. In 1620, the first confraternity dedicated to the Black Nazarene was established.

      In 1767, the popularity of the icon was recognized by Christian leaders when the Black Nazarene was moved to the Quiapo Church and its devotees followed.
  

      Church historian Fr. Emilio Edgardo Quilatan explained that the statue was made of Mesquite wood, which darkens as it ages.
  

      ”It is not due to the candles of the devotees or because the ship that carries the image was burnt,” Quilatan told CNN Philippines, dismissing a popular legend about the statue.
  






Huge crowds gather in Manila for the procession.




      While this year’s procession was largely peaceful, more than 700 people sought medical attention for wounds, fainting, sprains and vomiting, the Philippine Red Cross said.
  

      About 3 million devotees took part in the last pre-pandemic Traslacion procession in 2020, which lasted some 16 hours, according to police."
